        diffractive lens effect below). This field of force is amplified as well and
        the resulting energy according to mc^2 must be considered as additional mass.
        Fields of force are true matter, especially gluonic fields, whose energy
        is much higher than the plain electron pair which is creating it. They
        are some
        sort of &quot;canned&quot; kinetic energy and they are responsible for nuclear
        energy.</p>

        <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Please
        observe that the cross section pattern is
        identical to that of the diffractive lens. Such a lens
        is possible because of the Huygens Principle. Each concentric obstacle stops or diffracts any wavefront whose
        energy is opposite in phase with respect to the focal point.
        Thus, all remaining Huygens' wavelets are roughly in phase on a binary
        basis. The main difference is its <b><i>hyperbolic</i></b>   shape
        especially on both ends.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Fields
        of force act like a diffractive lens because waves cannot travel freely through antinodes,
        where the aether density is variable. This is an undisputable principle:
        waves need a medium whose density must be constant in order to propagate
        with a constant velocity. They do travel
        freely through nodes, where density is constant, but they are weakly but
        surely scattered by
        each antinode. Thus, the addition for so many of them is finally decisive.&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Clearly, the
        amplified field of force should act more or less like an emitter whose
        structure is that of the diffractive
        lens. There is a converging effect. A significant part of the energy is
        focused towards both electrons. From another point of view, the field
        acts like a &quot;diffractive mirror&quot; capable of returning back all
        waves incoming from two electrons simultaneously. This explains <b><i>radiation
        pressure</i></b> and also <b><i>action and reaction</i></b>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left"><b>The phase rotation.</b></p>
        </font></font><p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">However,
        it is not that simple because the whole concentric node and antinode structure is moving away
        from the center. This produces a phase rotation, which is very regular
        everywhere because variable radii for concentric areas are compensated
        by variable velocity. Obviously, such a field alone cannot focalize energy because it is constantly rotated in phase in such a way that
      outgoing waves only are amplified.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">But
        it is not the case if the pattern is periodically stopped much the
        same way a stroboscope can apparently immobilize any rotating unit such
        as a wheel or a fan.</font></p>
      <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">
        <p align="left"><b>The stroboscope effect.</b></p>
      <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">The
        electron acts like a perfect stroboscope because all its node and
        antinode structure oscillates simultaneously. The electron is a finite
        standing wave system, but its partially standing wave area nevertheless
        expands through billions of wavelengths. Its influence inside the field
        of force is determinant.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">So,
        when two electrons come rather close together, the wave addition clearly
        produces a stroboscopic effect on the field of force, at least in their
        respective area. Theoretically,
        three traveling wave trains are involved. If phases do not coincide, nodes
        and antinodes are weakened. They are rather strengthened when all three
        phases coincide.</p>
      <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">The
        important point is that this process is simultaneous. The electron spin
        does not matter either because nodes and antinodes appear simultaneously
        for both spins, while they appear with a pi / 2 phase offset for positrons whatever their spin. In all cases, this partially cancels the
        phase rotation inside the field of force.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Finally,
        the amplification process produces Huygens wavelets which are mostly in
        phase with respect to electron or positron pairs, but the phase is
        opposite for an electron in the presence of a positron on a go and return trip.
      Then an attraction effect rather occurs as a result of stronger waves
      incoming from the opposite side.</p>
        <p align="left"><b>The electron synchronization.</b></p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Additionally,
        in the presence of many electrons, the stroboscopic effect between each
        of them matches constantly because all electrons oscillate
      simultaneously. If the phase does not match exactly for a given electron,
      the whole oscillating structure will correct the anomaly. This
      synchronization phenomenon also influences the
      positron spin as long as it is not well secured inside a proton. It will slowly transform into an electron unless it
        previously reacts with the nearest electron and produce a quark.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">This
        occurs inside and around regular atomic structures because electrons are
        always nearer to each other. The nucleus may rather contain many positrons
        where the phase synchronization is compatible because the gluonic field
        conveniently produces a central area where the phase in <b><i> quadrature</i></b>
        allows it. The animated diagram below clearly shows this surprising phenomenon.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">The
        stroboscopic effect is also well visible. The diffractive lens structure
        is no longer regularly moving away from the center. It is rather moving
        by successive pulses separated by a pause. This happens because the electron partially standing waves
        (where outgoing waves are stronger) progressively
        transform into pure standing waves nearer to its center.&nbsp;</p>

        Matter
      in the whole universe contains as many positrons as electrons because most
      atomic structures maintain an equilibrium between them. As a matter of
      fact, positrons are not different from electrons except for phase, which
      is quadrature.
      Antimatter is just a relative point of view, especially because
      electrons or positrons are submitted to the Lorentz transformations.
      Obviously, their frequency should slow down when they are moving very fast. Thus
        fast moving matter with
      respect to an observer at rest is constantly transforming into antimatter,
      then into regular matter, and so on.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">
      <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">
        Any
        moving electron is constantly transforming into a positron, then into an
        electron
      of opposite spin, and so on according to four pi / 2 phase steps. This is
      the cause of electric fields and magnetic fields involving the Lorentz
      force. As seen from any
      unmoving matter, electrons moving inside parallel feeders produce
      induction and self-induction as a result of the phase rotation. Similarly,
      electrons moving inside a coil constantly exhibit a phase rotation which
      explains the magnetic effects. When they are positrons, they cannot react
        with unmoving electrons in the coil, firstly because their phase changes
        rapidly, and secondly because their path inside any conductive atomic
        structure is free from electrons. Otherwise, moving electrons hitting
        matter certainly produce strong effects such a light emission and even
      X-Rays for faster speed.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Thus
      many moving electrons behave like neutral particles inside unmoving
        conductive matter, but they still behave constantly like electrons with
      respect to each other. Because of this elasticity, they behave like a moving
        medium for high frequency electronic waves. This strongly suggests that
        their true speed inside a 300 Ohms TV feeder, for example, is certainly not
        80% of the speed of light, which is the signal velocity. The electron
      true speed is rather slow, and they simply move
        to and fro in the case of standing waves.</font></p>

        Additionally,

      <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">My
        most recent analysis of the global effect reveals that it should be a
        mix between the well-known Fresnel diffraction pattern and the Airy disk.
      It is quite uncertain because my
        program for this becomes much too slow if the goal is to analyze the whole
        emitting, then receiving 3-D space vs. a complete phase rotation. However, using shortcuts, the computer
        indicates that
        the axial alternating higher and lower amplitude zones, which are
        typical of both the Airy disk and the Fresnel diffraction pattern,
        should be still present.&nbsp;From another point of view, it is a well
      known fact that apodization
        erases all traces of such patterns. But it is unlikely to be possible
        here because the source energy should match the Gaussian normal
        distribution.&nbsp;Clearly, it is not the case here.</font></p>

        <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Fields
        of force are responsible for action and reaction because they can
        simultaneously focalize energy towards two electrons in two opposite
        directions.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Fields of force are matter. They
        contain energy
        according to E = mc^2 and they are submitted to the Lorentz
        transformations. So the node and antinode structure (hence all ellipses)
        undergo a contraction according to g and the phase wave according to
        Lorentz's t' equation maintains a virtual simultaneity for action and
        reaction. And finally, the Doppler effect is not perceptible from the
        field point of view because shorter waves move slower than longer
        ones, which rather move faster with respect to the frame of reference. Thus, the radiation pressure on both
        electrons is constant whatever their relative velocity or direction.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Amazingly, in spite of the Doppler effect,
        fields of force
        always act as if they were at rest. This principle is not really related
        to Relativity because there is only one frame of reference to consider,
        that of the field of force. It is rather one of the most important
        principles related to the <b><i>New
        Mechanics</i></b>, and it will allow us to easily upgrade
        Newton's laws.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">For
        example, Newton's third law &quot;For every action there is an equal but
        opposite reaction&quot; actually means that from the field's point of
        view, there is always opposite and equal action. It should rather
        be called the &quot;Principle of Double Action&quot; because
        the electrostatic field of force focuses energy equally towards both
        electrons whatever their true speed. Instead of a billiard ball hitting
        another one which is at rest, one can more easily consider that both
        balls are simply bouncing on each other like this:</p>

        is no simpler way to mathematically obtain the correct results because,
        from an absolute point of view, action and reaction <b><i>are not</i></b>
        equal. Newton was wrong on this because he was not aware that kinetic
        energy is the consequence of Lorentz's mass gain. The diagram clearly
        shows that when both 1 kg balls (M = a + r and total mass T = 4) are temporarily stopped, the
        field of force contains m = 2 kg (delta = T <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: FR-CA; mso-fareast-language: FR; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">–</span>

        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">It
        should be emphasized that the total mass T for both balls and the field
        of force is constantly 4 kg. So the law of conservation of energy is
        still valid, but it is true only as seen from the field of force. After the collision, the ball on the right hand side may be
      considered at rest and its mass should be 1 Kg. But the other ball would
        seem to move away according to Poincaré's law of velocity addition:

      <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Beta
      1 and beta 2 are both sin 60° = 866, so beta
      prime is .9897 and gamma is exactly 7. This means that, from each ball point of
      view, the mass for the other ball moving away at 98.97% of the speed of
      light is 7 kg. So the total mass is 2 * 4 = 8 kg according to beta = .866 and
      gamma = 2 because the frame of reference velocity has been accelerated from 0 to .866.</font></p>
        
      <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Clearly,
      the total mass and energy is dependent on the frame's velocity.</font></p>

    the one hand, action and reaction are equal only if the frame is at rest. So
    it is much preferable to presume that it <b><i>is</i></b> at rest...</font></p>
        
    <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">On
    the other hand, if one billiard ball is moving and the other one is at rest
    from the observer's point of view, the speed and mass for both of them must
    be firstly converted according to Poincaré's law of velocity addition. Then
    the calculus for the energy transfer becomes possible according to active
    and reactive mass. It is just a matter of active and reactive mass addition,
    which can be easily performed in a single operation if there is no
    significant deformation. For oblique collisions, active and reactive mass
    must be tempered according to the cosine of the angle (actually the Doppler
    effect).&nbsp;</font></p>
        
    <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Finally,
    all results must be converted once again. I admit that this procedure seems
    to be the hard way, but it is likely to be unavoidable in order to obtain
