        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Louis
        de Broglie rightfully proposed that matter mechanics should be called
        &quot;The Wave Mechanics&quot;. But scientists
        usually prefer <b><i>quantum mechanics</i></b> because of Planck's constant.
        Even though this constant is useful, the wave properties are far more important.&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">I
        am of an opinion that Newton's laws are still highly relevant on
        condition that the law of Relativity is invoked. This occurs because, as
        Christian Doppler himself discovered, a moving observer cannot perceive the
        Doppler effect in his environment. Newton's laws need some minor
        adjustments, though, because Poincare was right: the speed of light is
        unattainable. Furthermore, in 1904, Poincaré also said in St-Louis,
        USA:</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
        
        &quot;The laws of physical phenomena are the same, whether for an observer
        fixed, or for an observer carried along in a uniform movement of
        translation, so that we have not or cannot have any means of
        discerning whether or not we are carried along in such a motion.&quot;</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Einstein
        proposed the postulate below in his 1905 first edition of his Theory of
        Relativity. It is clearly similar to Poincaré's:</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="FR-CA">&quot;The
        same laws of electrodynamics and optics will be valid for all frames of
        reference for which the equations of mechanics hold good.&quot;</span>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Newton's
        laws are definitely wrong from an absolute point of view, though. They
        should be replaced by Lorentz's laws based on the Lorentz
        transformations, which are definitely and absolutely true because it is
        how the Doppler effect transforms matter. The goal is to examine what is
        really going on. The point is that, from a mechanical and absolute point
        of view, the aether is the only admissible frame of reference. Any
        moving wave system must still be represented under the same space and
        time coordinates. Because any moving wave system undergoes the Doppler
        effect, the Lorentz additional mass, which is kinetic energy as a result
        of the wave contraction, must also be imperatively evaluated in the same
        unmoving frame of reference.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Then
        action and reaction especially prove to be frankly unequal. I found that
        <a href="sa_active.htm">Active and Reactive Mass</a> based on the
        Doppler effect are highly useful in order to evaluate active and
        reactive forces. The same calculus also indicates how forces will act in
        a fast moving systems and proves that Newton's laws are no longer valid.</p>
        
        <p align="left"><b>Matter is made of waves.</b></p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">We
        know since Louis de Broglie that matter particles exhibit wave
        properties.
        Indisputably, matter works by means or waves. Let us
        make it perfectly clear : there is no alternative. At this stage, it is
        not an assumption, it is a certainty.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Additionally,
        the electron is not a metal marble covered in chrome. It cannot be made of matter. It is rather matter
        which is made of
        electrons.&nbsp;So, let us postulate that the electron is a standing
        wave system. Furthermore, these waves cannot be plane. They should be
        spherical.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">So,
        when two electrons come very close together, the wave addition must lead

        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Because
        the field of force may be seen as thousands of stacked lenses focusing
        towards both electrons, one should indeed expect a strong lens effect
        from it. But from an optical point of view, those lenses definitely
        cannot work because the concentric zones are moving away from the
        center. The phase rotation cancels the focusing effect.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Fortunately,
        the electron works very much like a stroboscope. This well known device
        can immobilize any rotating system, and it is also true in the case of a
        phase
        rotation. The electron is indeed a perfect stroboscope because its
        standing waves periodically appear everywhere simultaneously, and then disappear. And
        because a significant part of the electrostatic field is located inside
        both electrons, this should activate the field of force amplification in
        such a way that some of the radiated energy is finally transmitted directly
        towards both electrons. Then the phase coincides and the radiation
        pressure is much more intense.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">On
        the contrary, the positron quadrature cancels the stroboscope effect and there
        is no radiation pressure any more. But the equivalent pressure
        responsible for inertia is still present on the opposite side. This
        finally ends up with a symmetrical attraction effect.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Additionally,
        more electrons in the vicinity should add their own
        standing waves to the process and a synchronization process should take
        place. Then the electron spin as a common phase or opposite phase (which
        is simultaneous) becomes evident. Positrons, however, are all hidden inside protons where
        the required quadrature is present.</p>
        
        <p align="left"><b>The shade effect.</b></p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">It
        should be understood that any attraction effect actually occurs as a
        result of a pressure from the opposite side.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">For
        example, all
        electrons and positrons in the sun collect their energy from <b><i>plane</i></b>
        aether waves, whose residual energy is smaller when they go on propagating
        towards the earth. Those propagating from the opposite direction are more
        powerful and finally, they will <b><i>push</i></b> the Earth toward the Sun.
        However, this shade effect is cancelled because all electrons and positrons in the Sun
        also send waves toward the Earth and the result is nil. So, gravity cannot be explained by a shade
        effect. This was also established by Poincaré, yet he was unaware of
        the radiation pressure mechanism. Actually, all waves emitted by matter inside the sun are not plane any more.
        They are obviously spherical, and the resulting radiation pressure for
        &quot;biconvex&quot; fields of force is definitely weaker than that of a
        &quot;plano-convex&quot; one. Now this explains
        gravity.&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The
        diagram below shows that the gluonic field, which is made of plane
        standing waves at least in the center, must radiate most of its energy on the axis.
        Unlike electrons and positrons, the field does not radiate the
        equivalent energy transversally any more. This is why the gluon shade effect
        really works. The gluon
        can attract all neutral, positive or negative particles all around except

        its mechanism, a compressible
        medium should transmit faster waves if the pressure is higher.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Standing waves alternately compress then dilate the aether substance inside
        antinodes. Then the wave speed is slower of faster according to the
        compression ratio and the wave is progressively scattered. Because

        matter. And because motion introduces a Doppler effect, hence a
        wavelength difference, motion inside an atom must generate a specific

        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The
        radius r is that of a plane circular aperture. The Fresnel-Fraunhofer
        diffraction pattern is typically present in the laser or pinhole camera
        beam, but any composite wave emitter should also produce a similar
        pattern. Thus, because the atomic nucleus exhibits wave properties and
        because its structure is obviously composite, it should produce similar schemes
        along privileged axes. This is not disputable.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Electrons
        should be very sensitive to those zero amplitude zones. They are likely
        to be captured inside any of them on a probability basis. The electron
        capture and expulsion process because of excessive heat then becomes
        easily explainable. Clearly, each atomic layer radius and the electron
        behavior inside them is directly linked to this pattern.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">On
        the one hand, any excessive energy input such as heat can cause the
        electron expulsion and the required energy should be always the same
        according to a specific Fresnel number. It is a <b><i>quantum</i></b> of
        energy.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">On
        the other hand, after a short period of time, the electron is captured
        again by another zero amplitude zone. Then it oscillates until it is
        fully immobilized and this process liberates the same quantum of energy.
        Oscillations will cause the wave pattern to undulate: this is how the
        light is emitted. The light frequency is that of the undulations.
        Finally, the emitted energy is always the same according to a given zero
        energy zone.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Then

          are three display options for amplitude, energy, and also standing
          waves, thanks to Mr. Marcotte's new calculus using Lagrangian. Reversing the wave direction (they return to their origin) or
          transforming traveling waves into standing waves is possible. A special
          function was added in order to check the
          reflector gain, for example that of the corner reflector, which is
          surprisingly effective. One can also observe why a parabola produces
          straight waves capable of staying inside a narrow energy beam.</p>
