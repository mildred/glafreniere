        The goal of the previous page was to expose the real effects of the
        Lorentz transformations, that is to say: a length contraction, a local
        time, and a slower behavior.
        Because of these, a moving observer cannot find out whether or not he is moving
        with respect to the aether. This is called Lorentzian
        Relativity.</font>

  light or radio waves seem to propagate more slowly according to g. However, the time needed for a radio signal

  if A' and B' want to check the distance between each other using a radar or a radio signal, they obtain the correct value in spite of two serious

  slower seconds but the radio signal velocity is also slower according to the
  same g factor. Thus they
  can still verify that the distance to the opposite moving observer is one
  light-second. They can also measure y or z distances correctly using radio wavelength

  transverse contraction. Otherwise, A and B would clearly observe that A' and B' are
  nearer while A' and B' would instead observe that A and B are more distant.
  There would be no reciprocity any more and their absolute speed with respect
  to the aether would become measurable. However, Lorentz and Poincaré were not
  aware that matter is made of waves. They had to laboriously use Maxwell's
  equations. So they wrote page upon page of equations on
  magnetic fields, electric fields, permittivity, permeability, light
  propagating through dielectrics. They had to explain the Fizeau experiment, the Michelson

    surprising because they were studying how electromagnetic waves should

    standing wave contraction phenomenon was totally unknown in 1900. It was

  the &quot;trial and error method&quot; (<i>par tâtonnements</i>). The Lorentz
  transformations are just a special case of Voigt's equations where the constant

        seconds for a 10 light-second distance. All observers must be positioned
        on the displacement axis. Now, suppose that B is moving away from A and

        slower, hence inaccurate hours with respect to an unmoving one: t' = g t

        is a rather complex notion because it involves both space and time. In
        addition, a Galilean frame of reference using incompatible
        space and time units definitely cannot help. Here, one postulates that
        there is only one Cartesian frame of reference, whose space and time
        units are absolute. They should be obtained thanks to phenomena which are well
        known for their invariability. It was the case for the meter, which was
        firstly established according to a fraction of the earth's meridian, but
        which is today related to a given wavelength. The time units are still
        established according the the earth's rotation with respect to the
        stars. Surely, referring to the earth is somewhat arbitrary, but this
        convention nevertheless exhibits absolute characteristics. As long as
        mankind is capable of imposing it on the universe, the universe must

        preferred frame of reference. This is indeed what Lorentz's Relativity
        admits as a compromise because absolute motion with respect to the aether
        is not measurable. Thus, we
        must consider that the speed of light c is 299792458 meters per second,
        that a second is the time needed for light to travel a 299792458
        meters distance and that a meter is the distance which is traveled by light during&nbsp; 1/299792458 of a second. Comparing to other well

        contracted transverse light beam which also exhibits tilted wavefronts,
        the Doppler effect conciliation and two different time effects (a slower
        frequency together with a phase wave leading to a time shift) which were

        definitely proves that matter really contracts. It especially proves
        that the wavefronts propagating transversally become tilted
        according to the theta angle: theta =
        arc sin (v / c). For example, if the speed is half of the speed of light
        as shown above, the theta angle is 30°. It is 45° if beta = 0.707 c.
        In addition, because of the beam-splitter contraction, the light beam also
        contracts. I also proved that the Airy disk or the

        I also created a series of videos on the Bradley stellar aberration.
        Let's suppose that sun moves with respect to the aether on the same plane
        as that of the earth's orbit (more or
        less the ecliptic plane). This configuration
        supposes that the earth's speed is faster when it moves in the same
        direction as the sun and that it is slower in the opposite direction.
        Thus, if a telescope is pointed toward a star whose position is
        orthogonal every six months, the results should at first glance become
        asymmetric and finally, reveal the absolute speed of the sun. Bradley's
        goal was to record a parallax for the nearest stars, but he discovered
        the stellar aberration instead.</font>

        But on the contrary, the videos below show that neither the parallax nor
        the stellar aberration are modified by the absolute motion, at least
        apparently. Many authors were of an opinion that Bradley's aberration
        proved that the aether does not exist because the 6-month results are
        (or more exactly: <b><i>seem</i></b>) perfectly symmetrical. So let's be
        clear: they were wrong!</font>

        <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Here, it is important to remind
        that my <a href="sa_scanner.htm">Time Scanner</a> is a useful tool which
        is capable of performing the Lorentz transformations on a given animated
        scene containing many material bodies. More exactly, it shows how a moving observer should see the
        scene. I did not correct the contraction because the important point is
        the symmetry and the simultaneity of the two focal planes. Sorry for
        this: the correction produces a fuzzy image because pixels are integers.
        If you prefer, you may stretch the final image according to 1 / g using <a href="https://www.photoshop.com/">Photoshop</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;

        videos show how a moving emitter produces a Doppler effect. In order to
        reproduce plane waves incoming from very distant stars, I use a parabola
        which must imperatively be contracted. Otherwise, waves are not plane.
        Additionally, the plane wavefronts become tilted according to the theta
        angle. Next, I had to compute two different small parabolas whose speed
        is not the same as seen above (the 6-month results are performed here by
        two parabolas moving in opposite direction instead). This is why they
        are contracted differently. The results are definitely not symmetrical,
        but the Time Scanner proves that they nevertheless appear symmetrical.
        The two convergent beams also seem to produce a focus simultaneously.</font>

        They are of the utmost importance for the future. Now, one cannot rely
        on suppositions and unverifiable arguments about optical phenomena in a
        moving system. It is all about Motion Optics, a new science which had
        never been proposed in order to explain Relativity. Motion Optics is a
        section of the new Motion Physics, which is based on the Lorentz
        transformations. Starting from now, those experiences will be
        corroborated by more accurate experiments.

        Because of the Doppler effect, it was predictable that the wavelength
        should contract forward and expand backward. However, the fact that the
        general diffraction pattern is identical on both sides is a surprise.
        What's more, the pattern on both sides contracts according to Lorentz
        predictions. The wavelength difference is not noticeable either because
        measuring the wavelength while moving is not possible without firstly
        producing standing waves by means of a flat mirror or reflector. The
        Hertz test or an interferometer actually measures the node and antinode
        position, which is the same on both sides. And finally, it will be
        seen below (No. 15), those standing waves contract. Surely, if the
        observer is moving along with this emitter, he is unable to notice the pattern contraction and the wavelength contraction because he
        himself is contracted.&nbsp;</font>

 Lorentz predicted that the frequency should slow down according to the
        contraction factor g. As a result, the Doppler effect forward and
        backward becomes perfectly symmetrical. Because of this, absolute motion
        is unverifiable, for example that of a distant galaxy. But the observer can still measure its
        relative speed. As a matter of fact, astronomers presume that distant
        galaxies are moving away from our own galaxy, but one should bear in

        But actually, the Lorentz symmetric Doppler effect is far more
        misleading. It was seen that matter contraction, the slower time and the
        local hours could fool the moving observer, but this additional symmetry
        is somewhat diabolic. The result is that nobody can say for sure what is

        The nature of matter waves is the same as that of all forces including
        light. Their speed being the speed of light, absolutely nothing can
        travel faster. I am rather surprised that so many authors are invoking
        Lorentzian Relativity in order to explain marginal effects such as EPR.
        In my opinion, a delayed effect may very well explain apparently
        instantaneous action as long as the cause influences two particles
        simultaneously and exactly in the same manner. The point is that a field of force always influences two
        particles simultaneously because it is standing in the center. It is
        invisible and hence it was ignored when scientists tried to explain
        those apparently strange phenomena. What's more, they are frequently
        explained differently and this proves that the conclusions are not so
        convincing.</font>

        Lorentz transformations apply to matter and to aether waves as a
        Doppler effect in such a way that our absolute motion through the aether
        is not measurable. This is the most stunning consequence, but it is
        not the most important. It should be emphasized that we are mainly
        dealing with matter mechanics in the presence of motion. The new
        mechanics as proposed by Henri Poincare is actually the Motion Physics.</font>

        they are highly understandable and familiar.</font>

        After a century of Relativity, scientists still rely on Newton's laws
        even though they are aware that their accuracy is problematic. They feel
        that Newton was not totally wrong. The challenge for the next century
        will be to upgrade his work. I already started the project but hundreds of physicists and quite a long time
        will be needed until it is complete.</font>
