          Lorentz and Henri
          Poincaré discovered in 1904 that observers cannot detect their motion
          through aether. For example, the Michelson interferometer yields a null
          result because it contracts. Or Bradley's aberration is perfectly
          symmetric, etc.&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">But
          this
          does not mean that the aether does not exist.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">On
          the contrary, Lorentz was firmly convinced that it should exist.
          So he established his equations (which he borrowed from Woldemar
          Voigt's Doppler equations) in accordance with the speed of light,
          which in his picture was absolute. He finally found that Voigt's
          constant k should be eliminated from his own transformations, because
          a stunning invariance occurs when&nbsp; k = 1.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Lorentz's
          equations were established in accordance with the postulate that the aether
          does exist.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The
          point is: all happens as if aether exists.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">So,
          today's common assumption that Michelson's experience ruled out the aether
          and that this hypothesis has been &quot;abandoned&quot; is definitely
          wrong. Nobody ever demonstrated that the aether does not exist. It remains
          an acceptable hypothesis.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">This
          is especially important because most phenomena and matter properties
          are still unexplained. For example, standing waves could explain
          magnetic fields, but they would need an aether. Matter
          particles also clearly exhibit wave properties. This strongly suggests
          that matter waves and the required medium should exist.</p>

          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Actually,
          there was a serious omission: the light frequency slows down. According to
          Lorenz, the apparatus (not space) should contract; additionally, the source
          frequency (not time) should also slow down. In such a case, the number
          of wavelengths along a transverse axis never changes whatever the
          speed. It
          also remains the same along the displacement axis after a 90° rotation
          because of the contraction.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The

          discovered that the light is made up of waves traveling thanks to a medium which
          he called the aether.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Then
          Fresnel studied polarization and realized that this behavior could not
          be explained by regular longitudinal waves. So he supposed that the
          light waves should vibrate transversally.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">This
          was the first mistake. Polarization can be explained by composite
          longitudinal waves, because the interference pattern can undulate
          transversally. This supposes that the light is emitted by at least two
          sources, one of them being stable (for example a proton) and the other one
          (for example an
          electron) very slightly vibrating along a straight or circular path.
          Moreover, the electron frequency is constant, but the light frequency
          is that of the vibrations. The light is emitted on a secondary frequency.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Then
          Einstein studied the photoelectric effect and he supposed that the light
          should be made of particles because, according to Planck's constant,
          it always contains the same amount of energy for a given frequency.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">This
          was the second mistake. Why should this
          constant amount of energy be imperatively attributed to light
          instead of electrons? After all, electrons are present for both the light
          emission and reception. So the quantum properties of light may be allotted
          to electrons as well. Finally, the emitted light really contains the
          equivalent of a photon of energy, but it is still just made of waves.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">And
          finally, Compton never explained
          how &quot;his&quot; photons were working. He failed to explain the true nature
          of electric and magnetic fields. He failed to explain the electron
          mechanism. All students in the world should
          read how he interpreted his results despite his total ignorance. They
          would realize that there is still a long way towards the truth.</p>

              <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Surprisingly,
              one hundred years later, nobody could really detect such a
              rotation, which is nevertheless universally accepted. This theory is wrong, though, and it is now a severe obstacle

              nobody knew that electrostatic fields work differently at atomic scale.
              Many electrons closely put together behave as a whole, and this
              significantly reduces the nucleus attraction effect. Moreover,
              because it is a
              composite wave emitter, the nucleus must radiate waves according
              to Fresnel's diffraction. The interference pattern exhibits
              periodic null amplitude zones where electrons can be captured. The

          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"> Gilbert Newton Lewis (1875-1946),
          a famous American chemist, believed that electrons were regularly
          distributed around the atomic nucleus. This was J. J. Thompson's
          &quot;plum pudding&quot; model. In 1912, he was aware that only the
          external electronic layer, containing a maximum of 8 electrons, was
          responsible for chemical binding.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Lewis
          also noted that 8 electrons regularly spaced on a sphere should be
          placed on the 8 vertices of a cube. He investigated this hypothesis
          and found that it was consistent with most chemical structures. Each
          element can be seen as a cube with a given number of electrons on
          its vertices, up to 8. Then one may join two or more elements together
          in such a way that empty vertices in one element are filled with one
          or two electrons from another element.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The
          Lewis method is still well known today, simply because it works. This
          is experimental evidence that the cubic structure is more then just
          a theory. However, Ernest Rutherford and Niels Bohr preferred the
          planet-like hypothesis, which replaced Thompson's model and is still
          accepted today in spite of the lack of proofs. Such an error is
          especially deplorable because Lewis' model was based on experiments,
          while Rutherford's was just hypothetical.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"> Lewis

          more complex phenomena definitely escape the opposite wave trains
          theory. For example, the first node diameter around the central core
          is .75 lambda for circular standing waves while it is rather a full
          wavelength wide in the case of spherical standing waves.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">What
          is more, the program below clearly shows that this variation actually
          depends on amplitude. Thus, if circular waves incoming from one side
          are stronger, the node is no longer circular. It becomes elliptic and <b><i>it
          may also move</i></b>. This is a first indication that two spherical
          standing wave sets can definitely influence each other. It is the very
          first step towards a mechanical explanation of Newton's action and
          reaction law.</p>

          example, Le Verrier did not really consider the fact that the sun is very large, making atoms from its
          surface attract Mercury differently. Mercury's orbit is indeed very
          small, from 46 to 70 million kilometers. There is frequently more than
          a 1° angle to the sun surface and the force according to the cosine is less than .9998
          in this case,
          not 1. The important point is that this angular difference is not constant because the distance
          is not. To say it simply, the attraction force is not exactly

          solar system. It certainly orbits around a center of gravity which is
          that of all the solar system. Jupiter and Saturn for example are huge
          planets containing a large amount of matter, and Le Verrier did not take their influence on the
          sun into account. He was not that meticulous. In addition, Jupiter
          remains in conjunction with Saturn for several of Mercury's orbits.
          Then a resonance effect could occur.</font><p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The
          solar wind is rather strong near Mercury and its effect may not be
          negligible for a whole century. It is slightly oblique because of the
          sun rotation. The 11 years cycle could also cause a resonance. One
          could also examine the radiation pressure from the sun, which is 9
          times stronger than on earth, and study how all that light and heat should be
          radiated from Mercury. Astronomers are now aware that Mercury is very slowly rotating in a
          peculiar way. Newton's action and reaction
          law should apply.</font><p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The
          true effect of motion on gravity is still not well known. The sun
          rotation could produce a torque effect. Gravity may not be fully
          additive, that is, gravity from Jupiter and Saturn could decrease when
          they are behind the sun. There are strong magnetic fields around the
          sun, which are also present in the solar wind around Mercury. This
          planet contains plenty of iron and may react just like a big magnet. Another
          cause could be the tide effect, which is severe on Mercury; actually, the forces involved could even destroy
          it if its orbit was a bit smaller.</font><p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">One
          should realize that a century is a very long period of time as
          compared to a 43&quot; of an arc shift. The
          point is that Mercury is a very small planet which is likely to react
          to dozens of small abnormal causes. Obviously, Le Verrier's
          calculus was inaccurate. Slowly but surely,
          searchers will study all of them and finally find which one has the
          most significant influence. Because Einstein did not examine any of
          them, his non-Euclidean tensor calculus is very likely to become

          However, space around the sun is filled up with particles which can
          produce a lens effect. The result is the same, but the cause is not.
          It is a well known fact that the light is severely deviated in the earth's
          atmosphere, even at very high altitudes.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">This
          occurs because there are still some air molecules and other particles
          there.
          It should be the same around the sun because of the solar wind. The same phenomenon should also occur around galaxies, which
          are surrounded with gas clouds, but the lens effect there is certainly
          not perfectly regular because the gas distribution is not.&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The
          Fizeau experiment showed that moving transparent substances such as
          water could modify the speed of light or produce a deviation. The point
          is that the solar wind particles are faster when their density is
          higher. This may partially
          cancel the deviation difference, but not exactly. So the deviation is
          certainly not constant, and the difference will become perceptible
          using more precise instruments.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">This

          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">In
          addition, the blue light deviates more drastically than red inside
          normal optical glass, but the difference becomes smaller for very
          light glass such as quartz or fluorite. It is even smaller for gas,
          and especially rarefied gas. So the deviation for red and blue should be
          almost identical, but not exactly. The difference should become
          visible using sophisticated devices, and this would also indicate here
          that Einstein's ideas are wrong. As a matter of fact, <b><i> space could not
          bend differently</i></b> for red and blue light...</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Any
          experimented astronomer should admit that Eddington's results
          were highly disputable. In 1919, they should have pointed out that his small Newton telescope, suffering from
          unacceptable coma, could certainly not record so small a deviation.
          However, more recent results indeed indicate a deviation, but they are
          strangely reported in a mystic manner. Such people bowing very low in
          front of their Einstein prophet should be considered with suspicion.
          We need more objective data, and they are unlikely to be constant. They will certainly not match exactly
          Einstein's predictions, which were probably influenced by previous
          astronomic observations.</p>

          finally, gravity cannot change the light wavelength either. Matter
          undergoes severe constraints on the surface of a very large star. This certainly
          changes the way light is emitted, and especially its wavelength. The whole
          process may even be fully compromised under more severe conditions

          be upgraded in accordance with the Lorentz transformations, making
          them perfectly correct and much simpler.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Henri
          Poincaré discovered that the laws of physical phenomena are the same
          for an observer at rest and for an observer moving at a constant
          speed, making it impossible to determine whether he is moving or not.
          He was well aware that this should be the starting point for some <b><i>new
          mechanics</i></b>.&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">From
          any observer's point of view, moving matter and all related phenomena
          undergo (or seem to undergo) the Lorentz transformations. A
          contraction occurs, the mass increases, the time there seems to slow
          down and the clocks do not indicate the same time on the displacement
          axis.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The
          goal is to take those phenomena into account in order to reformulate
          Newton's laws. For example, the mass gain is given by the gamma
          factor: gamma = 1 / sqr(1 <span lang="FR-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:

          Then kinetic energy, which is related to this gain, can easily be
          deduced from it. Finally, kinetic energy is not linked to Relativity
          any more; it is just a consequence of the Lorentz transformations. The
          formula below for kinetic energy is already well known and replaces
          Newton's inaccurate E = m v^2 / 2:</p>

          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">A
          simpler example is the action and reaction law. It will be still fully
          accurate if one postulates that the field of force, which is located
          between two material bodies and responsible for this, is considered at
          rest. Then there are no action and reaction any more, just two
          opposite and equal actions. Suppose that a billiard ball hits another
          one. The calculus becomes simpler if both balls are considered to be
          in motion. If their mass is the same, they will simply bounce back at
          the same speed according to the formula above. The final step is to
          recover the observer's frame of reference. This means that Newton's
          action and reaction law must be upgraded to a double opposite and
          equal action law, which is true only if the field of force, not the
          observer, is considered to be at rest.</p>

                  comments about this on the web are followed with the
                  unavoidable &quot;lol&quot;, which as far as I know means
                  &quot;Laugh out loudly&quot;.</p>
                  <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">However,
                  it is a well known fact that most radio waves, and also X-rays
                  and gamma are not stopped by matter. Because the light is
                  actually an exception, it would be simpler to postulate that
                  all waves go freely through matter. Then, in order to
                  explain why the light seems to be stopped, deviated or reflected,
                  one can prove that electrons react to light and emit some new
                  light whose phase is opposite.</p>
                  <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Firstly,
                  because of the opposite phase, this new light will interfere
                  with the other one and produce a shade behind opaque objects.</p>
                  <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Secondly,
                  this new light will also produce a reflection in accordance
                  with Huygens Principle.</p>

                  thirdly, because transparent material such as glass produces
                  reflections through more than a full wavelength, their sum is
                  null and the wave energy is transmitted from one electron to
                  another. Then some new light is emitted on the other side.
                  This phenomenon is possible only inside very homogenous
                  substances.</p>
                  <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The
                  shade behind any opaque object can be calculated using
                  Huygen's Principle:</p>

                  <p align="center">This is the shade of a 1mm wire at 4 meters
                  (about 13 feet).</p>
                  <p align="center">This is possible if matter emits some new

                  <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Here are the results below. The upper opaque screen simply
                  stops the waves, and a shade appears. The lower one rather
                  emits new waves whose phase is opposite. Surprisingly, the
                  result is exactly the same. Both systems produce perfectly

                  Lorentz transformations were intended to correct the Doppler effect in order to make Maxwell's equations invariant in any moving frame or reference.
                  Lorentz was strongly convinced that matter should contract. He was well aware that a time shift should occur, and also that clocks should
                  tick slower.</p>
                  <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Unfortunately, Lorentz's original equations do not yield correct results from this point of view.
                  They rather
          indicate an expansion. They can be reversed, though, by swapping the x and x'
                  variables:</p>
        
              <p align="center">x'
              =&nbsp; g * x + beta * t</p>
        <p align="center">t' = g * t <span lang="FR-CA" style="font-family: Times New Roman; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: FR-CA; mso-fareast-language: FR; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">–</span>
        beta * x<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Then
                  they produce the correct results. So the program graphics (see below) use
                  the reversed equations, and one can easily see that all happens the way Lorentz predicted.</p>
        
                  <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Surprisingly, the same formulas also produce a special Doppler effect involving a slower frequency.
                  Here is a program showing this:</p>

                  <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">I am of an opinion that Lorentz's Doppler equations should always be present together
                  with his original ones, in order to justify the correct contraction and the time effects.</p>
                  <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">It should be emphasized that the Lorentz transformations are
                  the greatest of all laws about matter's mechanical behavior, making Relativity
                  <b><i>much less</i></b> important. After all, Relativity is just
                  a secondary result, that is, the result of any moving observer's errors.</p>

                  conclusions are not disputable. Since one century, physicists
                  wrote tons of weird ideas about the Lorentz transformations.
                  Please bear in mind that those transformations belong to
                  Lorentz, who was a great scientist. They should be explained
                  the way Lorentz did. But they are not. Look at this:</p>

                  this a shame? Fortunately, it is likely to change because
                  computers cannot handle so inane ideas. If you are a pro in
                  computer programming, you surely can check this. You will
                  finally admit that Lorentz was right about matter contraction.</p>
                  <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">My
                  own program on the Lorentz transformations displays the x' and t'
                  coordinates for a given beta normalized speed. One can use the cursors to
          modify beta, x and t. The program also displays a material body
          undergoing the transformations. There is no surprise: all happens the
          way Lorentz predicted.</p>
