<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Matter
mechanics is highly dependant on kinetic energy, which is the consequence of
motion. In the absence of motion, there would be no mechanics. Because it is a
measure for a given motion inside a given space, the time itself would become
meaningless.</p>
        
<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">In
addition, matter is made of waves and all forces are caused by waves. Thus,
matter mechanics should be called the wave mechanics, albeit it is more
specifically the fields of force mechanics.</p>
        
<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">And
finally, waves plus motion obviously lead to the <a href="sa_Doppler.htm">Doppler
effect</a>. This web site has demonstrated a long time ago that the
<a href="lorentz.htm">Lorentz Tran</a><a href="sa_Lorentz.htm">sformations</a>
are just a special Doppler effect which applies to the electron. This is why it
becomes more and more powerful at very high speed.</p>
        
<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">This page explains why and how kinetic energy is related to this additional energy.
Then it will become clear that Newton's laws are preferable to Einstein's
mechanics because they are well known and much more understandable. However, they need some
adjustment in order to hold perfectly true.</p>

<p align="left"><b>The field of force contains pure kinetic energy.&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Two bags
filled with sand cannot produce an elastic collision. Some of the energy is
rather converted into heat, making the final result very hard to analyze. So
let's take a better example. Suppose that one billiard ball hits another
billiard ball head-on .</p>
        
<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">In this
case, the repulsive force is that of the electrons, which behave like springs
because of the Coulomb force. There are billions of them and they come very
close together when both surfaces collide. At this moment, the electrostatic field, which
is made of standing waves, contains a maximum of energy. It is potential energy because it will be transferred to the other ball.</p>
        
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/champbiconvexe01.gif" width="301" height="201"></p>
<p align="center">The electrostatic field of force.</p>
        <p align="center">It is made out of traveling waves incoming from two
        electrons or positrons.</p>
        <p align="center">This produces standing waves, which are amplified
        afterwards by all other waves in the vicinity.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        
<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">It is a
well known fact that standing waves contain energy. Here, the field of force is
only a
temporary one. It is made out of waves emitted by electrons.&nbsp;</p>
        
<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">I showed in
the page on <a href="sa_plane.htm">standing waves</a> that in case of motion,
standing waves transform into &quot;moving standing waves&quot;. In this case,
nodes and antinodes are still present but they are moving according to the
forward vs. backward Doppler ratio. Then the energy is transferred at the same
speed, which is always slower than the speed of
light.</p>
        
<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">That is why
the field of force acts just like a spring. All of its potential energy, hence
mass, was borrowed from the first ball and it is transferred to the second one.</p>

<p align="left"><b>The energy calculus.</b></p>
        
<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Newton was
totally unaware of this process. Surely, the Newtonian formula for kinetic energy
below needs a severe upgrade.</p>
        
        <p align="center">E&nbsp; =&nbsp; m v<sup> 2</sup> / 2</p>
<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">In this
formula, E&nbsp;stands for energy in joules and m for mass in kilograms.
Distances being in meters, v stands for matter speed and c for the speed of
light in meters per second. This equation was forged by Voltaire's wife, Emilie Du
Chatelet. However, the calculus leading to this achievement originated most
certainly from Leibniz, who also created the differential calculus independently
from Newton. It can easily be derived from Newton's two main equations on
acceleration, especially f = m*a.</p>
        
<p align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        
<p align="left"><b>The Newtonian formula contains two errors.</b></p>
        
<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">It was
discovered more than a century ago that this formula becomes inaccurate at very high
&quot;relativistic&quot; speed. Lorentz found that mass should increase
according to the gamma factor. This should be considered as one of the Lorentz transformations
because matter contracts and clocks slow down according to the same &quot;</font></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">g&quot;
ratio.</p>
        
<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Below,
capital M stands for mass while matter is moving very fast. The
mass gain is added to the mass at rest and it can easily be obtained using Lorentz's
gamma factor: gamma = 1/g.</p>
        
<p align="center">M&nbsp; = gamma *<font face="Symbol" size="4">
        
        </font>
        
        m</p>
        
<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Today, it
is well known that mass is a measure of matter inertia and also a measure of its
energy. The total mass M increases according to the gamma factor. It becomes
theoretically infinite at the speed of light so that any speed faster than the
speed of light is impossible. For
instance, a billiard ball whose mass at rest was 1 kg transforms into a 2 kg
ball and it becomes two times shorter (only on the x axis) at 86.6% of the speed
of light according to the gamma factor (gamma = 2; g = 0.5).&nbsp;</p>
        
<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The
spherical billiard ball shown above on the right hand side is accelerated to 0.866 c and
it is submitted to the Lorentz transformations. It becomes a squashed ellipsoid 50% shorter
and its
mass is doubled to 2 kg.</p>
        
<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Because its
inertia is also doubled, the ball cannot be accelerated again to 2 * 0.866 = 1.732 c
using the same amount of energy. Additionally, this speed is much faster than
the speed of light. Adding another kilogram of energy would rather increase its total mass M
from 2 to 3 kg. Then gamma = 3, g = 1/3 and the new
beta normalized speed is given by:</p>
        
<p align="center">beta = Sqr(1 <span lang="FR-CA" style="font-family: Times New Roman; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: FR-CA; mso-fareast-language: FR; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">–</span>

<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Thus, if

        </p>
        
<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The first
step is to modify the Newtonian formula for kinetic energy in such a way that
the mass gain is taken into account. This is obtained quite simply by applying
the gamma factor:</p>
        
<p align="center">E&nbsp; =&nbsp; m v<sup> 2</sup> / 2&nbsp;&nbsp; is replaced
by:&nbsp; E&nbsp;
        =&nbsp; gamma * m v<sup> 2</sup> / 2</p>
<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">However,
this new formula still yields incorrect results. Poincare (followed by Einstein) rather
elaborated this equation:</p>
        
<p align="center">E&nbsp; =&nbsp; (gamma *
        m <span lang="FR-CA" style="font-family: Times New Roman; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: FR-CA; mso-fareast-language: FR; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">–</span>

        1) m c<sup> 2</sup></p>
<p align="center">This formula proves to be perfectly accurate. The gain in mass
is indeed given by: G&nbsp; =&nbsp; (gamma <span lang="FR-CA" style="font-family: Times New Roman; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: FR-CA; mso-fareast-language: FR; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">–</span>

<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Here, the
speed was carefully chosen in order to obtain kinetic energy which equals the
mass at rest: exactly one kilogram. The next step will be to explain why the
modified Newtonian formula elaborated above still does not work. It seems that
the division by 2 needs some more adjustment.&nbsp;</p>
        
<p align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        
<p align="left"><b>2 <span lang="FR-CA" style="font-family: Times New Roman; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: FR-CA; mso-fareast-language: FR; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">–</span>
 Slowing down fast moving matter needs energy.</b>
        
        </p>
        
<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Newton
stated that action and reaction are equal, but Lorentz showed that this
principle was wrong at high speed. The purpose of the division by 2 was that
half of kinetic energy had to be used in order to stop the incoming billiard
ball. This is indeed a well known Newtonian law: the moving billiard ball needs
energy to be slowed down and the stationary ball needs energy to accelerate. As
long as the speed is not too fast, the process is perfectly symmetrical and this is why the Newtonian
formula using only one half of the energy yields fairly accurate results:</p>
        
<p align="center">E&nbsp; =&nbsp; m v<sup> 2</sup>&nbsp;/ 2</p>
<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">However,
the energy required to stop the moving ball never changes because it always
returns to its 1 kg original mass. On the contrary, the accelerating ball needs
two times more energy. This indicates that a ball moving at nearly the speed of
light, which contains more than 1000 kg for example, needs only 1/1000 of this
energy to be fully stopped. It becomes negligible in comparison, so that most of
the energy is used to accelerate the other ball. In such a case, a more accurate
equation should be:</p>
        
<p align="center">E&nbsp; =&nbsp; gamma * m v<sup> 2</sup>&nbsp;/ 1</p>
        
<p align="center">E&nbsp; =&nbsp; M v<sup> 2</sup></p>
<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">This
strongly suggests the well-known formula: E = mc^2.&nbsp; The equivalence
between intrinsic energy and kinetic energy now becomes obvious.
      </font> 
 <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">And
it becomes clear that the division by two is wrong. It should rather be modified
progressively according to Lorentz's factor. Then one finally obtains a

      a given quantity of protons and neutrons. Once again, this occurs because
      the gluonic field structure is different, making their standing waves more
      powerful.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">I
      suppose that electrons and positrons, whose mass is less than 1% of
      matter energy, are almost indestructible. Scientists systematically
      explain that they &quot;annihilate&quot; when they collide. But this
      appears to be much too simple an explanation because they do not speak
      about the gluonic field, which is certainly the chief cause of the
      enormous quantity of energy which is liberated. I strongly think that,
      when the powerful gluonic field is destroyed, the radiation following the
      explosion could very well hide the electron and the positron which are
      liberated. This is comparable to stars becoming invisible during the day
        because of the sun.</p>

      huge number of electrons and positrons distributed in a finite space
      should lead to their acceleration because of the Coulomb force, and
      ultimately to their junction as quarks. If they do not instantly destroy,
      there is a small chance that three of them become a neutron, and then a
      more stable proton. The important point is that kinetic energy is
      converted into potential energy inside gluonic fields in such a way that matter finally contains
      much more energy then that of its electrons and positrons. The gluonic
      field shown below is the result of the addition of the electron and positron standing
      waves. However, they are amplified afterwards, making the two initial particles
      relatively much less energetic.</p>

      two apparently separate entities which nevertheless are present in the
      same object and share the same properties. Energy for both of them is
        given by the same m c squared equation. What's more, their behavior is clearly
      linked to the Doppler effect: this was demonstrated in the previous page on

        when the system is no longer stationary as a result of the wave
        compression, which is a mere consequence of the Doppler effect.
        Moreover, inertia is a resistance to a force, which produces an
        acceleration according to f = m*a. This is quite possible solely in the
        presence of waves. All standing waves contain energy. In the presence of
        another standing wave set, the wave addition and the subsequent
        amplification by more aether waves traveling in the vicinity surely can
        exert a radiation pressure. This scheme indicates that all other aether waves

        properties of light and that he then released this formula. He was thus well
        in advance as compared to Einstein.</p>

        waves are responsible for all action and reaction forces. I could not
        examine Poincare's document because I live in North America, not in
        France. Some of his works are not easily available because Poincare was
        not allowed to publish them in most French scientific publications.
        Although I ignore how he came to this conclusion, I am quite sure that
        his reasoning was as good as that of Einstein.</p>
        
<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Einstein
only established the corollary, that is to say the reaction that a material body
would oppose to a given quantity of emitted light. His attitude was unfair
because he never quoted Poincare. Most scientists consider that Einstein found
the famous equation alone. However, it is a well known fact that he was fully
aware of Poincare's works. So there is no place for admiration here: on the

        Relativity indicates that they are totally false. The point is that the
        absolute truth will always remain hidden. Mainly because of the Doppler

        second law is especially confusing because it indicates that a force

        consider that this body is stationary. In this case, the Lorentz
        transformations do not apply and the mass is simply the mass at rest. It
        is already well admitted that the center of inertia, even for multiple
        material bodies undergoing action and reaction forces, cannot undergo
        any direction or speed variation. Finally, only the speed difference
        must be applied separately to those bodies and the Lorentz
        transformations are not to be taken into account if this difference is
        not important. In this case, one should consider that Newton's laws are

        rather relative to the observer's frame of reference, which must however
        be chosen carefully. Surprisingly, they both yield accurate results.
        This is quite comforting as compared to Einstein's Relativity, which was
        rather plagued with paradoxes which could easily be interpreted as
        contradictions. For example, two observers whose speed differs always
        see &quot;the other one&quot; being contracted. This annoying reciprocity should be
        avoidable. The situation is even worse if more than two observers moving at
        different speeds are present. The choice of an acceptable frame

        those fields exert a radiation pressure in two opposite directions. The
        forward and backward force is proportional to the wave contraction or
        dilation in accordance with the Doppler effect. However, it always
        appear equal on both sides on condition that the field of force is
        postulated to be stationary at the center of inertia of the system. Then Newton's
        equal and opposite action and reaction law holds true. The important
        point is that the center of inertia may easily be considered constantly
        at rest because interactions between many material bodies do not change
        its status. It is the perfect place for a truly impartial and reliable
        arbitrator. This leads to much simpler calculus because Relativity (even
        Lorentzian) is no longer to be considered. Let's be honest: nobody could
        really deal with Relativity, including Einstein himself! However, the

        light. We can observe two electrons traveling in opposite directions
        colliding at nearly <b><i>two times</i></b> the speed of light. This is
        true as seen from the collider, but not as seen in a fast moving frame

        because all other planets are involved and also because the correct

        considering the whole solar system, the sun itself is rotating around a
        center of inertia. And this idea of bending space is totally absurd.
        Let's face it: Einstein's method is quite weird.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Gravity does not obey exactly
        Newton's equation for Mercury's short distance to the sun. This occurs
        for the same reason that there is no gravity at
        all in the center of the sun while the formula yields an infinite result.
        Near to the sun, some of its mass exerts a gravity force from an angle.
        Thus, the gravity curve is bending there much the same way Ricci tensors
        do. It is very easy to arbitrarily make them reach the point which
        produces the correct perihelia precession. Frankly,
        the so-called &quot;error&quot; is frankly negligible and does not
        invalidate Newton's equation. It just indicates that other anomalies are

        be clear: gravity is just an ordinary force. Basically, it obeys
        Newton's equation, albeit some situations need additional correction. In
        a very fast moving frame of reference, all forces are submitted to
        relativistic effects. Not just gravity. Surely, establishing a complex,

        is the effect or the cause of a force which is applied during a given
        period of time or along a given distance. It may produce an acceleration
        or a deceleration, and it can also change the direction. Matter
        velocity is well known to be kinetic energy, but potential energy as a
        material field of force is not yet well accepted. The important point is that a
        field of force is capable of accelerating matter thanks to the radiation
        pressure. The best example is
        the electrostatic field of force shown above.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Two
        electrons or two positrons produce a repulsive field of force while an
        electron and a positron rather produce an attractive field of force. In
        both cases, the result is an acceleration, hence kinetic energy.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">This
        occurs because electrons or positrons are constantly pulsating spherical
        waves. The space between two of them is automatically filled with
        standing waves, which are responsible for the <a href="sa_electrostatic.htm">Coulomb
        force</a>.&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Those
        standing waves are amplified by all aether waves in the vicinity, the
        same way electrons are. The more they are close together, the more they
        contain energy. This energy is returned toward both particles and the
        phase determines whether the effect will be attraction or repulsion.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">I
        was able to show recently that, on condition that the medium is compressible
        (such as air), standing waves are capable of modifying the speed of
        waves traveling along the axis. This phenomenon will be easily
        verifiable using acoustic devices. It becomes clear that waves may
        exhibit variable behaviors depending on the medium properties. They
        definitely have a &quot;personality&quot;. For example, larger waves on
        water travel much faster than small waves. Yet, most physicists still
        rely on equations to study waves. This attitude hides the fact that we
        are dealing with a rather complex and surprising phenomenon. The main
        conclusion is that <b><i>spherical standing waves are capable of
        interaction</i></b>.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">An
        electrostatic&nbsp; field of force does not contain any electron or positron. Except for its effects,
        it is quite difficult to detect as a place containing significant
        amounts of energy. It may be considered as matter according to the
        famous m c squared equation, especially when electrons and positron come very
        close together. Then the field of force progressively transforms into a
        gluonic field, whose energy is much greater than that of an isolated
        electron. I strongly believe (but it is still to be demonstrated!) that
        this system, which contains an electron, a positron and a gluonic field
        of force, should be a <a href="sa_quarks.htm">quark</a>. Three quarks

        a mechanical point of view, one may consider that the field of force is
        located exactly at the center of inertia, which is in the middle of the
        axis joining the electrons or the positrons. The mass of all electrons
        being the same, it becomes clear that its force should apply equally on
        both electrons, especially if the center of inertia and the observer are
        postulated to be stationary.</p>

        attraction or repulsion effect is a consequence of the radiation
        pressure, which is applied equally in opposite directions by the field of force. This suggests
        Newton's action and reaction law, but in this case the center of inertia
        does not move. If it were moving, action and reaction would not be equal
        any more because the Doppler effect would produce waves whose wavelength
        differs forward and backward. The result is unequal active and reactive
        forces incoming from <a href="sa_active.htm">active and reactive mass</a>,
        which is present inside the field of force.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">If
        the mass of two material bodies is not the same, the acceleration is
        faster for the smaller body. As a result, the center of inertia remains
        stationary. However, in the case of gravity between the moon and the
        earth, for example, the fields of force are repulsive fields which are
        placed beyond each of them. The moon seems attracted, but it is actually
        pushed towards the earth. A &quot;virtual&quot; attractive field seems
        to be placed exactly in the middle, not at the center of inertia. The
        result is a simultaneous action which neutralizes a possible torque
        effect. Many authors had noted that gravity should be transmitted
        instantaneously (not at the speed of light) in order to avoid such a

        frame of reference of an isolated material body is obviously the one
        where it seems stationary. One could hardly think that its frame of

        along a straight line. This is what Newton seems to admit, though. If it
        seems to move, the frame of reference is rather that of an observer
        whose speed is not the same. Such an idea could be acceptable according
        to Galileo's Relativity Principle, but it is now totally obsolete
        because of the Lorentz transformations. Today, the only acceptable frame
        of reference is Cartesian, not Galilean, and it must be postulated to be
        stationary.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">This

        theoretically be at rest as compared to the aether. However, Lorentz and
        Poincare also discovered that such a reference is unverifiable. The only
        remaining compromise is to simply postulate that a given frame of
        reference is stationary. This choice is indeed possible according to
        Relativity. If a material body is moving (or if it seems to be moving)
        inside this frame of reference, one must consider that it is undergoing
        the Lorentz Transformations, more exactly the Doppler effect. Lorentz's

      Principle. But when relativistic speeds must be taken into account, the
      forces become unequal. <a href="sa_active.htm">Active and reactive forces</a>
      appear. As seen from the center of inertia, they are proportional to the
      forward and backward Doppler effect. Thus, a fairly accurate calculus for
      the solar system using the Double Action Principle appears feasible, but a
      highly accurate calculus using active and reactive forces would be much
      more complicated to perform.</p>

      <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The
      dynamics of matter is all about wave dynamics. However, for practical
      reasons, one should rather name it the fields of force dynamics. The
      important point is that the Lorentz transformations and Relativity must be
      taken into account in order to upgrade Newton's laws on motion.&nbsp;</p>
        
      <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Einstein's
      Theory of Relativity is very annoying to deal with because it doesn't
      appear logical. Especially, it always yields two different and reciprocal
      results. For example, two observers whose speed
      is not the same always see &quot;the other one&quot; undergoing a contraction. One should
      admit that this reciprocity is not a &quot;paradox&quot;. Let's face it,
      it is purely a contradiction which indicates that one of them at least
      (and more likely both of them) is wrong because he is fooled by the
      Doppler effect.</p>
        
<p align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        
      <p align="left"><b>The preferred frame of reference.</b></p>
        
      <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The
      good news is that the composite field of force responsible for
      interactions between two (or many) material bodies is located at the
      center of inertia, which may most of the time be postulated to be
      stationary. The point is that it does not move whatever the result of the
      interaction. This is the perfect place to establish a preferred frame of
      reference where an observer will not be fooled by the Doppler effect. From
      this point of view, the situation is no longer symmetrical because it is
      unique. All other observers should admit that this place is indeed a
      reliable one to establish the Cartesian axes. They have no choice anyway:
      it is the unavoidable condition under which Newton's laws on motion hold
      true.</p>
        
      <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">On
      the one hand, the observer placed at the center of inertia is impartial
      because he doesn't have any reason to prefer any other situation. His frame
      of reference is the best one, it is unique, and as seen from this place <b><i>there
      is no Relativity</i></b> any more. His only remaining task is to establish
      the amount of transformation of all other moving bodies according to
      Lorentz's equations. My Time Scanner can also perform this operation.</p>
        
      <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">On
      the other hand, this impartial observer certainly doesn't see what is
      truly going on. Lorentz and Poincare discovered that the only one and absolute
      situation will remain unknown forever.</p>
        
      <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">This
      indicates that, most certainly, action and reaction are unequal from an
      absolute point of view. They are proportional to action and reaction forces
      as a result of the Doppler effect. Moreover, they are not simultaneous. Newton's laws on
      motion being revisited, let's examine why and how
      causes produce effects.</p>
        
<p align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p align="left"><b>A new Causality Principle.</b>
        
        </p>
        
      <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">It is
      true that every effect has a cause. But today, it becomes obvious that this
      effect is a motion and that the cause which produced this motion was a
      wave traveling through the aether at the speed of light. Motion appears to
      be the result of a modification of forward and backward matter wavelength
      according to the Doppler effect. Lorentz discovered that there is no
      wavelength modification transversally: y'=y; z'=z. This singularity (the regular
      Doppler effect introduces a wavelength contraction transversally) supposes
      that the electron frequency slows down according to Lorentz's contraction
      factor.</p>
        
      <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">It
      turns out that the process is strongly dependant on the speed of light,
      which introduces a delay between a cause and its effect.</p>
        
      <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The
      important point is that effects transform into new causes, which then
      produce new effects. This endless chain reaction is the basis of matter
      mechanics and we have shown that, quite surprisingly, a mechanical wave
      propagates much the same way.</p>
        
      <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">So,
      in that order, we have a motion, a stronger compressed emitted wave
      because of the Doppler effect, a field of force when this wave encounters
      another one incoming from another material body, a radiation pressure
      generated by the field of force towards this body, and a motion again. As
      seen at the electron scale, the splendor of our universe is nothing but
      the sum of motions generating more motions.</p>
        
      <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Thus,
      a new Causality Principle might be worded as follows:</p>

        causes are always different, it appears unlikely to be possible that the
        &quot;the same causes always produce the same effects&quot;. Such a
        statement introduces a serious problem about determinism. The future might be the inexorable sum of all of today's
        causes, but this is
        unverifiable.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Around
        1900, during the period preceding the discovery of Relativity,
        scientists were divided. They could not reach a consensus about a
        mechanist or a probabilistic approach. The probabilistic choice could
        rule out the hard to conceive determinism. Statistics prove to be quite
        logic, and most randomly distributed events sometimes end up with
        surprising coincidences. But a mechanism leading to liberty appears
        improbable. If Newton's laws are unavoidable, the mechanistic choice is
        the only logic one.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Our
        situation could be that of passengers traveling in a train wagon.
        Considering that the railroad is already in place and that it leads to
        some unknown destination, which is however already well established, we
        can merely observe the landscape and wait until our fate is
        accomplished. However, most people categorically reject this philosophy.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">To
        be honest, the ultimate question should rather be: what was the Cause of
        the aether?</p>
        
<p align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p align="left"><b>The speed of light is constant and decisive.</b></p>
        
<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Any
radiation is transmitted through the aether at the speed of light. Because
energy decreases according to the square of the distance law, the same radiation
cannot produce the same effect everywhere simultaneously and with the same
force.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">In
        addition, because of the Lorentz transformations, a moving phenomenon is
        (or seems) severely distorted. Because of the Doppler effect, the waves
        traveling forward are slower and the mechanical result is a local time,
        which is given by Lorentz's t' second equation. In addition, the speed
        of light traveling in a moving system is slower, even from an absolute
        point of view, because the light path is longer, especially axially.
        This was discovered by Michelson. Thus, forces are also distorted
        proportionally and matter mechanics as well. Surely, <a href="sa_relativity2.htm">Lorentzian
        Relativity</a> appears much more reasonable today, and it strongly
        suggests that matter is made of waves.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">It
        becomes clear that Newton's laws on motion are strongly related to the
        speed of light in a way that Newton never suspected. The famous m*c
        squared equation must definitely be integrated to Newton's mechanics,
        considering that the speed of light &quot;c&quot; is constant with respect to the
        aether.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Surely,
        Einstein's postulate stating that the speed of light is the same
        in all Galilean frames of reference is wrong.</p>

        gravitational field of force seems present between two material bodies.
        It apparently attracts them from an arbitrary center of inertia. But

        four fields of force, whose component finally pushes them towards each
        other.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Let's
        be clear: gravity is not linked to Relativity. Elaborating a complex
        &quot;General Relativity&quot; in order to just explain gravity was a
        mistake. Gravity is much more simply explainable thanks to the <a href="sa_fields.htm">fields
        of force dynamics</a>. This method proposes the center of inertia as a
        preferred frame of reference. The interesting point is that it allows
        one to consider that this place is no longer submitted to Relativistic
        effects. What's more, Newton's formula on gravity can be recovered
        without any modification, on condition that any moving material body is
        postulated to be submitted to the Lorentz Transformation according to
        its speed as it is seen from this frame of reference. This includes the
        gain in mass, which is responsible for kinetic energy.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Frankly,

        important point to remember is that Newton was unaware that matter waves are undergoing the

        mechanics, the obvious conclusion to draw is that one must now take the
        Lorentz transformations into account. This should fix the problem
        forever.</p>

        phenomenon such a an emitter frequency should slow down. For example,
        assuming that beta is 0.866, the electron frequency would be reduced to
