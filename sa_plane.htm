        a standing wave is the result of two wave trains traveling in opposite
        direction. One may add that both amplitude and wavelength should be
        equal in order to obtain regular standing waves. If the wavelength
        differ, though, the results are quite surprising.<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"> From 1981 to 1990,
        Mr. Yuri
        Nikolaevich Ivanov conducted meticulous experiences using sound waves in
        the presence of wind. What's more, he proposed some totally new and
        interesting hypotheses on matter mechanics based on this phenomenon,
        which he called &quot;lively standing
        waves&quot;. However, because he deserves it, I suggest that it should be
        named after him. &quot;Ivanov's waves&quot; is indeed a more specific
        and appropriate name.&nbsp;<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Ivanov's
        waves were the missing link between
        Lorentz's Relativity and the still-to-establish matter mechanics. This
        phenomenon must be taken to be the basis of all laws of physics. Hence,
        it should systematically be considered when it comes to studying a
        moving system, especially in optics and acoustics. Fortunately, it is
        easily understandable and verifiable.<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">This

        Ivanov pointed out that the wave intrinsic energy is moving at the
        system speed, which I called &quot;Alpha&quot;. Obviously, each node
        being at a constant zero energy point, it behaves like a mirror. The
        reflected energy is moving to and fro between two successive nodes so
        that it finally follows the system.<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">That
        is why it is misleading to consider that standing waves contain two sets
        of traveling waves. They may be generated and,<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: FR-CA; mso-fareast-language: FR; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA" lang="FR-CA">

        different. It is especially the case for spherical standing waves, where the full-wavelength central antinode
        definitely does not submit to this interpretation.
      <p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/huygens00.gif" width="547" height="281"></p>
      <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">It is
      a well known fact that traveling waves do not interact. However, standing
      waves do. The antinode position may be slightly shifted sideways if the amplitude is no
      longer the same on both sides. It is the fundamentals of matter mechanics.<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">In spite of this, I
      did use the theoretical wave addition method in order to produce Ivanov's
      waves below simply because it produces satisfactory results most of the time.

        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Apparently,
        the Doppler contraction phenomenon was discovered by A. A. Michelson,
        who tried to detect it by means of his famous interferometer in 1887.
        Henri Poincare was referring to it as &quot;the aberration&quot; and he
        frequently spoke about &quot;the aberration squared&quot;. Because of
        Einstein's Relativity, Lorentz's contraction factor was
        replaced later by the gamma factor, which is the reciprocal: gamma = 1 /
        g.<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">In
      brief, there
        was no consensus on the choice of a symbol standing for Lorentz's
        contraction factor. The letter
        &quot;g&quot; appears relevant because of its relationship with the
      Greek symbol gamma. Its value is usually related to the normalized speed
        beta, which applies to the electron and to matter, but one may use the alpha speed as well:</font><p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="5">g

        three animated Gifs below indicate that, if the wavelength differ, the
        node and antinode envelope is experiencing a contraction. The regular
        acoustic Doppler shift produces a transverse contraction according to g.
        The contraction along the displacement axis x is given by g squared. The
        relativistic Doppler shift produces a less severe contraction according
        to g on the x axis and there is no transverse contraction.<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Please note
        that the animations below are displaying Ivanov's standing waves as seen
        by an observer moving at the alpha speed. This is why the node and antinode pattern <b><i>seems to be
        stationary</i></b>. However, it is actually moving at the alpha speed with
        respect to the medium. I had to make this difficult choice years ago
        because the size of such animated Gifs had to be very small.&nbsp;Unfortunately,
        this way, the phase wave is no longer displayed correctly.

        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Mr.
        Ivanov also pointed out that, assuming that electronic waves are
        responsible for chemical bindings, this behavior obviously explains the
        Lorentz-FitzGerald contraction. As a matter of fact, Lorentz had shown
        that such a contraction perfectly explains Michelson's null result, but
        rigorously on condition that the frequency slows down according to his
        contraction factor.<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Most
        of the time, although it may be generated otherwise, the wavelength
        difference is caused by the Doppler effect. Unfortunately, Mr. Ivanov only experimented on sound waves, which are undergoing a severe
        contraction (and also a transverse one) because of the acoustic Doppler
        effect. The relativistic Doppler effect produces a less severe
        contraction because the basic frequency is slowing down according to
        Lorentz's factor. In this case, no transverse contraction occurs any
        more and this is why our absolute motion with respect to the aether becomes
        unverifiable.<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="FR-CA">The
        video below shows that Ivanov's waves are undergoing a less severe
        contraction if the Doppler effect is relativistic.</span>

        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">I
        am of an opinion that explaining matter contraction was Mr. Ivanov's
        most significant breakthrough. It definitely sheds
        some new light on Lorentz's Relativity. The phase wave (see below),
        which was discovered by Mr. de Broglie many years after Lorentz's 1904
        paper, should also improve our comprehension of Lorentz's &quot;local
        time&quot;.

        most accurate clocks are regulated using oscillation periods which are
        known to be amazingly constant.
        However, the phase wave is delaying the pulsation phase in the front of a moving
        system so that the period fluctuates along the displacement axis.
        The period is in advance at the rear and hence, the hour displayed
        by several moving clocks is progressively retarded forward according to their x
        coordinate. This is the true cause of Lorentz's &quot;local time&quot;.<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">So,
        apart from ticking slower, moving clocks exhibit a time shift. The most
        spectacular confirmation of this is that a clock synchronization
        procedure ends up with the equivalent time shift because of the
        relativistic Doppler effect. The regular acoustic
        Doppler effect is incompatible with such a result.

        waves may be displayed on a computer screen using the Lorentz
        transformations. However, Lorentz's original set does not yield correct
        results because of multiple anomalies, including space and time
        incorrect interpretation. It appeared preferable to elaborate some
        specific transformations which apply solely to Ivanov's waves. I called
        them &quot;Alpha Transformations&quot; because they are marking the
        beginning of a great new science trek. Thanks to it, studying Relativity
        and Matter Mechanics will henceforth be much easier.</span><p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="FR-CA">The goal here is not to deal with space and time. Theoretically,
        Ivanov's waves are just the result of the addition of two wave trains
        propagating in opposite directions and whose wavelength differ. The only
        available variables are those two wavelengths. Thus, we are in the
        presence of a quite basic physical phenomenon which should definitely
        not require the use of non-Euclidean geometry...</span><p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="FR-CA">Firstly,
        the variables x and x' are to be given in wavelength units.
        They must be converted into pixels afterwards because the goal is to
        display Ivanov's waves on the computer screen. Secondly, the phase t must be given in wave period units, and then converted
        into radians. Although they are space and time units, they are
        definitely not to be
        given in meters and seconds.</span><p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="FR-CA">Surely,
        today's Relativity is a mess because the equivalent precalculus for the
        electron and for matter was not carefully explained by Lorentz, Larmor
        and Poincare. Fortunately, one must also get rid of Maxwell's equations
        because the Alpha Transformations also apply to acoustic waves, which
        are not &quot;electromagnetic&quot; in nature.</span><p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="FR-CA">The
        table below should be useful in order to deal with Ivanov's waves. The
        two wavelengths, forward and backward, are the only variables. It is
        shown that, in all cases, the x and t variables must be given according
        to the geometrical mean wavelength. As a matter of fact, in the case of
        the acoustic Doppler effect, the forward and backward wavelengths are
        shorter. Thus, x and t will refer to a shorter geometrical mean
        wavelength and the Alpha Transformations will finally reproduce the

        indeed generated by electrons, protons and other particles because the in-between space is
        filled up with waves traveling in opposite directions. It is especially
        the case between two electrons, where an electrostatic field of force
        takes place. For example, let's consider a billiard ball hitting another one. Their speed being different, the relativistic
        Doppler effect produces two different wavelengths so that the field
        moves at the &quot;alpha&quot; speed. The field energy is also moving at
        the alpha speed so that some of the moving ball energy is progressively
        transferred into the unmoving ball. That is why the latter is finally
        accelerated while the other one is stopped.</span>

        the Earth's absolute motion with respect to the aether is unverifiable,
        Lorentz's Relativity rather relies on a preferred frame of reference,
        which is postulated to be stationary. It is not, actually, but this
        assumption allows one to discover an even more surprising fact. The
        truth is that, in the presence of many frames of reference whose speed
        differ, any of them may be postulated to be stationary without creating
        any anomaly in the overall results.</span><p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="FR-CA">The
        goal here is to compare two systems moving in opposite directions at the
        same speed. Their contraction and their &quot;time&quot; (at least at
        the origin) being the same, there is no &quot;space-time
        transformation&quot; to be considered any more. It can be shown that
        those two moving frames of reference may easily be exchanged according
        to Poincare's Relativity Postulate using the intermediate
        &quot;Alpha&quot; preferred frame of reference. Because of its absolute Cartesian coordinates,
        it is the best way to reconcile the two other ones. If one uses the
        Alpha intermediate speed, the twin paradox and
        the train and tunnel paradox are especially easier to deal with. Thus, there are finally three frames of
        reference to be considered. This new approach is definitely preferable
        to Poincare's or Einstein's Relativity, which proves to be incorrect in
        this case. On the contrary,
        Lorentz's version of Relativity still holds true.</span><p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="FR-CA">It

        even though both results are produced using the same procedure.&nbsp;</span>

        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="FR-CA">Using
        acoustic waves, Mr. Ivanov could elaborate an in-depth analysis of his
        &quot;lively standing waves&quot; in a moving environment. However, the
        alpha speed as a reference using Poincare's law of speed addition may
        appear rather exotic. There is one situation where the alpha speed
        remains perfectly relevant, though. In this case, two wave generators on
        both sides are truly stationary and a reflecting screen is moving along
        the in-between axis. The Hertz test is well known to produce standing
        waves, but in this case the screen is moving. Hence, although the
        original waves are not undergoing the Doppler effect, the reflection
        process produces two Doppler shifts in a cascade. The waves are severely
        contracted on one side while they are rather severely dilated on the
        other side.&nbsp;</span><p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The
        Doppler effect on a moving screen is not frequently shown. So, it is
        worthwhile to carefully examine the results on both sides in the video
        below. Clearly, Ivanov's standing waves are still present. What's more,
        they are nevertheless moving at the alpha speed, which is that of the
        screen.

        should be emphasized that this phenomenon works with both acoustic and
        Hertzian waves. The node and antinode structure is moving at the screen
        speed, but the contraction differs on both sides. The absolute motion of
        the screen with respect to air may easily be deduced by comparing the
        two resulting wavelengths. However, assuming that the reflecting screen
        is unmoving and that the two emitters are moving at the same speed and
        in the same direction, it is still impossible to detect their absolute
        speed through the aether because of the relativistic Doppler effect.</span>

        peapod-like envelope. This unusual form of Ivanov's waves is interesting because electrons contain such &quot;partially moving

        when electrons move closer, electrostatic fields of force progressively
        transform to gluonic fields.</span>

        experiencing the well known Fresnel-Fraunhofer diffraction pattern.
        However, most of them still ignore that this interference pattern is
        still present if the emitter is moving. In this case, the equiphase
        pulsation must be transformed using Lorentz's t' phase wave. In
        addition, the emitting device must be contracted in the direction of
        motion according to Lorentz's contraction factor g. The two small videos

        moving, those waves must travel according to
                an angle in order to follow them through the wind.
                This is Lorentz's theta angle, which is given by: ArcSin(beta).
        Thus, because they are tilted, many successive wavefronts moving in opposite directions

        would add that Mr. Ivanov already tried to solve the energy problem using what
        he calls &quot;Rythmodynamics&quot;. This is brilliant. I developed my own
        interpretation of rythmodynamics, though, because traveling waves do not interact. Only standing waves do, and
        this is good news because fields of force and matter do consist of
        standing waves. Clearly, one must inevitably consider fields of force when it comes
        to analyzing forces and energy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><span lang="FR-CA">Some
        characteristic frequencies are already capable of extracting some energy
        from
        matter. For example, visible light produces
        chemical reactions in plants. Infrared radiation or heat are involving
        lower frequencies or vibrations which cause hydrocarbons to burn in
        the presence of oxygen. Such phenomena are possible because of the
        external 8-electron atomic layer, which is responsible for chemical
        bindings. I already shown that the cubic structure of the atom perfectly
        explains chemical bindings. This strongly indicates that electrons do not rotate
        around the nucleus. If they are stationary, they may be captured in front of any of
        the 8 vertices if this position is unoccupied. In the image below, the electron from one atom was
        captured by another atom.</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><span lang="FR-CA">The
        point is that this configuration is highly elastic. In spite of the
        strong forces which maintain the molecule cohesion, it is capable of
        high amplitude vibrations. Heating this molecule beyond a given
        threshold (or exposing it to a strong infrared radiation) will
        ultimately separate the two atoms. This process requires energy, though.</span></p>

        <p align="center">Chemical bindings are vulnerable to vibrations.</p>
        <p align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><span lang="FR-CA">On
        the contrary, cold carbon and oxygen atoms do not normally produce
        carbon monoxide or dioxide. They must be heated so that the quivering
        movement randomly forces electrons from one atom to penetrate any of the
        capture areas of another atom. What's interesting here is that this
        process produces strong additional vibrations because the two atoms react as if they
        were tied up into one molecule by a powerful spring. The resulting heat
        may bind more atoms together in the vicinity so that a chain reaction is
        triggered. This is how fire is created.</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><span lang="FR-CA">But
        this is only the tip of the
        iceberg. It is a well known fact that, inside protons and neutrons, gluonic fields are responsible for extremely powerful
        forces.&nbsp;</span></p>

        stationary because they are made out of two sets of
        standing waves.</p>

        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="FR-CA"> We
        should definitely examine how all those fields of force do react to
        different input frequencies. Any stable field of force actually reacts like a compressed spring.
        Strong vibrations on a constant
        frequency or on a series of constant harmonics may cause gluonic fields
        to transform to a lower or higher energy configuration, or to be
        created or destroyed, triggering a
        burst of energy. By chance, because of the resonance conditions, the
        process may even trigger a chain reaction.</span>&nbsp;</font></td>
