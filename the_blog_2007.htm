          page on the <a href="sa_Doppler.htm">Doppler effect</a>  have been
          updated once again. Web browsers sometimes cannot display Greek symbols,
          especially on Linux/Unix. So I finally decided to make many Gif images
          to solve the problem.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">I
          tried to make this page the simplest possible. The goal is to explain
          Relativity, which is just a consequence of the Doppler effect. So
          Relativity should be &quot;relatively&quot; simple...&nbsp;</p>

          made a new video showing the <a href="sa_scanner.htm">Time Scanner</a>:</p>

          <p style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">This video shows
          that the Scanner can either produce or correct the Doppler effect.<p style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Below
        is another video showing better the same phenomenon without the Scanner.
        Please note that Lorentz's time shift is actually a phase shift which becomes
        well visible if the emitter is a hoop. So the emission process begins in the
          rear; it is not
        simultaneous for a given circular wavefront. This
        phenomenon is especially amazing.

          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">This
          device is one of my favorite inventions. It works beautifully.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">It
          is much more polyvalent than Lorentz's equations because it can handle
          multiple transformations simultaneously, even transverse and oblique
          ones. It can also perform the law of speed addition, which never
          reaches the speed of light.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">And
          finally, it is much more logical than Einstein's Relativity because it
          always performs transformations without any &quot;paradox&quot;. This
          is not really a surprise because it reproduces perfectly Lorentz's
          Relativity.&nbsp;</p>

          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">The
          page on the <a href="sa_Lorentz.htm">Lorentz transformations</a> has

          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">This
          page is likely to become a favorite because it does not severely hurts
          scientists' well accepted ideas, at least for most of its content (see
          &quot;errors to correct&quot; below, Nov. 24). However it goes farther
          than Lorentz and certainly sheds some new light on his famous
          transformations, especially because the Doppler effect is clearly
          involved.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">It
          is consistent with Lorentz's ideas, making it acceptable at first
          glance. As a matter of fact, scientists are respectful to Lorentz
          because he was a great discoverer. However they are definitely not
          respectful to his transformations, which are severely
          &quot;transformed&quot; today in a despicable manner. Here is an
          example:</p>
                  <p align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_transformation">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_transformation</a></p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Let's
          face it: Lorentz himself would be horrified. After all, those
          transformations belong to him. They should be explained the way he
          did, albeit one can still add his own point of view.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">I
          pointed out how my Time Scanner can reproduce them in such a way that
          they appear simpler. This device indeed produces the same Doppler
          effect, slower frequency, length contraction and time shift in a
          mechanical way. I even made a new video showing this:</p>
        <p align="center"><a href="avi/The_Time_Scanner_01.avi">The_Time_Scanner_01.avi</a></p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Linux
          users could not see Greek characters because this operating system
          does not display them correctly via the HTML code. I made more GIF
          images in order to definitely solve the problem. Now, all equations
          with Greek symbols should be displayed correctly in this page whatever
          the OS or Internet browser. Linux users should be aware that many
          other pages still display incorrect symbols.</p>

          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Wrong ideas about matter are worse than no
              ideas at all. They become an obstacle for further analysis.
              Scientists admitted too quickly a lot of hypotheses which were never
              clearly demonstrated. This page lists many of them.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Scientists may sometimes be wrong. Whatever
                  their number is, it is not relevant because they all blindly
                  accept today's well accepted ideas without verifying them. On
          the contrary, they reject this web site's content because it does not
          seem consistent with those ideas, also without verifying it.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">To
          say it shortly, they never verify. They just memorize. Surprisingly,
          the lazy way is an effective one towards lucrative college and
          university degrees, but it is nevertheless the best one towards error.</p>

          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">My
          new program on the Lorentz transformations displays the x' and t'
          values for a given beta normalized speed. One can use the cursors to
          modify beta, x and t. The program also displays a material body
          undergoing the transformations. There is no surprise. All happens the
          way Lorentz predicted.</p>

          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">It
          should be pointed out that Lorentz believed that Michelson's
          interferometer should really contract. However, his equations rather
          indicate an expansion (the goal was to correct the Doppler effect in
          order to achieve a perfect invariance on Maxwell's equations). So they
          must be reversed in order to yield the correct x' contracted values.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">However,
          Henri Poincare's reversed equations were rather intended to retrieve
          the x and t original values. The Lorentz Doppler reversed equations
          are different: the x, x' and t, t' variables must be swapped. I found
          a long time ago that those reversed equations produce a Doppler effect
          involving a frequency reduction. So I also made a program showing
          this:&nbsp;</p>
        
          <p align="center"><a href="programs/Doppler_Voigt_transformations.bas">Doppler_Voigt_transformations.bas</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          <a href="programs/Doppler_Voigt_transformations.exe">Doppler_Voigt_transformations.exe</a></p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">This
          program proves that Lorentz's equations are just a special case of
          Woldemar Voigt's equations on the Doppler effect (1887).</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Let's
          make it clear: the Lorentz transformations are nothing but a Doppler
          effect. Then, because the electron is a wave, it should undergo those
          transformations. And finally, because molecule binding is achieved by
          electrons, matter must also undergo the Lorentz transformations. So it
          must contract.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">It
          is that simple.</p>
          <p align="left"><b>October 31, 2007</b></p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">I
          made several DivX-MPEG-4 videos. The goal was to show that
          Lorentz was right. He (and FitzGerald) discovered that Michelson's
          interferometer cannot reveal the aether wind because a contraction
          occurs on the displacement axis. This cancels the difference between
          on-axis and orthogonal light paths.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">However,
          in such a case, the 45° mirror or beam splitter should also undergo a
          contraction, making the 90° reflection apparently incorrect. Many
          scientists argued that the interferometer contraction was impossible.
          Poincaré especially spoke about an &quot;ad hoc&quot; explanation
          without any valid reason and finally, Lorentz's hypothesis was ruled
          out. It was a huge mistake. Lorentz's contraction really occurs in
          such a way that any observer moving along with a wave system can no
          longer detect its motion. All seems to happen as if he was at rest.
          This is Relativity.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Those
          videos show clearly that the mirror must be tilted to an additional
          angle in order to reflect the light beam to the correct 90° angle. I
          made one for all axes and directions, and also with the incorrect
          45° angle. It turns out that the new angle is consistent with
          Lorenz's contraction g factor. So the interferometer <b><i>must</i></b>
          contract: there is no other logical explanation. <b><i>Lorentz was
          right.</i></b> It is that simple.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">I
          am of an opinion that this experience is even more important than
          Michelson's. As far as I know, the light beam behavior inside the
          moving apparatus has never been displayed. Thanks to Mr. Philippe
          Delmotte's Virtual Aether, it is now possible. Many scientists don't
          even know that the light beam waves must be tilted to the theta angle
          = arc sin (v / c) in order to propagate transversally. Moreover, the
          light beam itself including Fresnel's diffraction pattern undergoes
          the on-axis contraction.</p>

          can use the Woldemar Voigt transformations (1887) in order to
          reproduce the normal Doppler effect because his equation set can
          reproduce any Doppler effect including the Lorentz transformations.
          They where firstly intended to cancel the Doppler effect on Maxwell
          equations, but I could reverse them like this:</p>
        
          <p align="center">x' =&nbsp; x * g * k + t * beta</p>

          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">However,
          Voigt's&nbsp; k&nbsp; constant for the regular Doppler effect equals
          Lorentz's&nbsp; g&nbsp; factor (it can even be eliminated from the
          Lorentz transformations, where&nbsp; k = 1). Finally, for the regular
          Doppler effect, one can use simpler equations without this
          annoying&nbsp; k&nbsp; constant:</p>
        
          <p align="center">x' =&nbsp; x * g ^ 2 + t * beta</p>

        <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">This
        is not a joke. Woldemar Voigt was a genius. His equations work. The program below shows that they
        can even reproduce the emitter's displacement:</p>
        
          <p align="center"><a href="programs/Doppler_Voigt_transformations.bas">Doppler_Voigt_transformations.bas</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">In
          my opinion, this demonstration indicates even better that Voigt's and
          Lorentz's equations are nothing else and nothing more than a Doppler
          effect. Clearly, the x' variable simply indicates a wave displacement,
          and the t' variable simply indicates a phase shift. Neither time nor
          space are involved, and Relativity now appears simpler. It is just the
          result of the electron Doppler effect, which matches the Lorentz
          transformations.</p>
        
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">More
          simply, the Lorentz transformations are still relevant <font face="Times New Roman" size="4"> but

          page on the <a href="sa_Doppler.htm">Doppler effect</a> is now
          upgraded and fully translated. You will find there a totally new
          approach for explaining the Lorentz transformations, hence Relativity.
          Clearly, those transformations are just a very special Doppler effect,
          that of the electron while it is moving. It simply involves a slower
          frequency which makes the transverse wavelength remaining constant: y'
          = y; z' = z.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">This
          is indeed a great achievement. Now, the Lorentz transformations are
          needless, albeit they are still relevant. Relativity will be much
          simpler because it is just a consequence of the electron special
          Doppler effect.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Incidentally,
          I discovered today that the regular Doppler effect could also be
          reproduced using a set of equations very similar to Lorentz's. It
          should be the equivalent of Voigt's transformations, but his unknown K
          constant will be replaced by Lorentz's g factor.</p>

          coexist and achieve the very high pressure and heat requirements.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">I
          hope that scientists will soon realize that spherical standing waves

          showed that the 2-D central antinode exhibits a 3 / 4 lambda diameter.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">So

          is of the utmost importance because those interferences produce a
          field of
          force. Its amplification makes it so that a very strong wave beam
          converges towards electrons or positrons which caused them. I could
          check that such a convergent beam should produce an Airy disk, just
          like most convergent beams except apodized ones. One must also
          remember that the Airy disk is just the diffraction pattern at the
          focal plane. It is called the Fraunhofer diffraction (its distance is
          infinite for the laser) while the whole
          diffraction pattern anywhere between the source and the Airy disk is
          called the Fresnel diffraction.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The
          pattern is different whether the source is plane or spherical. When
          two electrons come very close together, their standing waves may add
          constructively even in the area beyond them. Then they radiate a perfect Airy disk
          exactly in their center. They transform into a quark with a gluonic field, where the forces
          involved are quite different. In addition, the phase in the center may
          be compatible with the positron's quadrature. So the whole system is
          no longer negative and three of them (three quarks) placed crosswise
          on the three Cartesian axes become a neutron,
          which may transform into a proton if a positron is captured in the

          of today, this English version contains 33 pages. This was a first
          step towards a full translation from the French site. However, at
          least 10 pages are under construction, and many other need a severe
          upgrade. Please be patient: this theory is getting better and better,
          slowly but surely.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">This
          is not only a translation process. I am still making new discoveries
          and I must write new computer programs in order to prove that those
          ideas make sense. I must also make new graphics, diagrams and
          animations. The good news here is that I decided to do all this in
          English. I will report new events here, so that it will be easy for
          you to stay well informed about the Wave Nature of Matter.</p>

          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">The
          Sept. 10 post below have been edited in order to confirm that my
          formula for the central phase offset is now correct. Here is the new
          program, which uses Mr. Marcotte's formula.</p>

          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Here
          is a challenge for mathematicians interested in waves. The animation
          below shows how a perfect spherical wave generator should behave.
          Although such a perfect generator does not exist, it will be very
          useful in the future for displaying only the theoretical electron
          so-called &quot;out-waves&quot;.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">On
          the one hand, the general amplitude (the black curve below) is given by: y = 1 /
          v, which coincides with y = 1 / x&nbsp; beyond x = pi. But the correct&nbsp; v&nbsp; value for the layer's volume is
          missing. It should be normalized to 1 in the center. Please note that
          any correct formula not related to volume would also be acceptable.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">On
          the other hand, there is a pi / 2 phase offset at the center, hence a
          full phase shift (positive to negative) from one side to another. So
          the electron exhibits an amazing full wavelength central antinode. I
          already found this formula for the phase correction inside the
          electron core:</p>
          <p align="center"><b>phase correction = pi / 2 * (1 - x / pi) ^ 2</b></p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Then the
          following formula will produce the exact moving and rotating spiral curves
          in the animation below:</p>
          <p align="center"><b>y = sin(t - x - phase correction) / layer volume</b></p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Here
          is a
          quote from Mr. <a href="http://members.tripod.com/mwolff/">Milo
          Wolff's</a> web site:&nbsp;&quot;Above is a photo of Milo comparing the waves of a particle with the layers of an
          onion&quot;.

          The

          outgoing layer

          <p align="center">The electron outgoing waves.</p>
          <p align="center">The requested formula should perfectly trace the
          spiral.</p>
          <p align="center">This spiral reproduces the helicoidal transverse
          view, where the phase is more visible.</p>

          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The
          wave energy is not equally distributed inside each &quot;onion
          layer&quot;, which thickness is apparently a half wavelength. It is
          probably sinusoidal, or maybe linked to the Gaussian normal
          distribution, which is given by: y = pi ^ <font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="FR-CA" style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: FR-CA; mso-fareast-language: FR; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">–</span></font>(x ^
          2) to a first approximation (or exactly?). It should be emphasized that the layer
          inner part becomes partly negative inside the core. It must be
          absolute (i.e. always positive), reversing the curve
          which finally reaches the y = 1 point at the center. I could show roughly the correct amplitude, but a simpler and exact
          formula for&nbsp; &quot;v&quot;&nbsp; would be preferable. Please
          note that the&nbsp; y = 1 / v&nbsp; formula for the electron general
          amplitude should be correct from the
          center to infinity: it traces the black curve shown above.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">This
          missing formula is important because the <a href="sa_phaseshift.htm">electron
          phase shift</a> must be present at the center whenever the goal is to
          show the interference pattern between two electrons or more. Actually,
          it is of the utmost importance for studying how fields of force and radiation pressure
          work. Otherwise, the phase
          difference will induce many people into error.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Mr.

          cos(x) / x&nbsp; are far more important, but this equation will certainly be one of tomorrow's
          most well known formulae.</p>

          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">I
          showed a long time ago that the Lorentz transformations had been
          established to cancel the Doppler effect. It was indeed Woldemar
          Voigt's goal in 1887. So I simply rearranged them in such a way that
          they would rather produce a Doppler effect:</p>

          <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The
          theta <font face="Symbol">q</font> angle is given by:&nbsp; arc sin(v
          / c) and the Lorentz&nbsp; g&nbsp; contraction factor by: cos <font face="Times New Roman"></font><font face="Symbol">q</font>. I also made a program
          showing that those equations indeed produce a Doppler
          effect, the x coordinates and the t time (the phase, actually) being
          modified. This Lorentz Doppler effect is a little different from the regular
          one because the frequency slows down according to the g factor.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">However,
          it is still nothing but a Doppler effect. And it applies to the
          electron, which is responsible for the structure and behavior of
          matter.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The
          point is: I finally discovered last month that one should preferably
          explain Relativity as a consequence of the electron's Doppler effect,
          not of the Lorentz transformations. As a matter of fact, it is quite
          unreasonable to interpret those x' a t' variables as a
          &quot;space-time&quot; transformation. One can speak much more simply
          about the electron's wavelength and phase transformation, which
          finally transforms matter.</p>
          <p align="center"><span lang="FR-CA">&nbsp;</span></p>
          <p align="center"><b>MY FIRST ENGLISH PROGRAM</b></p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Now
          I can prove that Relativity is true simply because the electron, hence
          matter, undergoes a special Doppler effect involving a slower
          frequency according to the g factor. It is the true reason why the
          clocks are ticking slower at high speed. Such a Doppler effect
          produces no wavelength contraction transversally (y'=y; z'=z according
          to Lorentz). And finally, matter contracts along the displacement axis
          because the electron's standing waves contract. Standing wave
          contraction is now a well admitted fact, indeed undisputable.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">So
          I proudly introduce here my first <b><i> English</i></b> program, which shows
          the electron's special Doppler effect.&nbsp;The FreeBasic source code
          is also in English. I must repeat here: please
          pay attention to this one, because this phenomenon alone explains
          Relativity. Here it is:</p>

          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">My
          discoveries are unlikely to become well accepted soon because they
          seem rather weird, at least at a first glance. It is quite a challenge
          to stay apart from a lot of other apparently similar sites, which on
          the contrary are
          truly weird. In addition, a lot of today's well admitted ideas (such
          as photons or electromagnetic waves) are false. Physicists and students
          must doubt them in order to become familiar with mine.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">This
          may take a long time.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">I
          must admit that the French version of this web site, which was created
          five years ago, is insufficient at this point. A more acceptable
          English version is required. Fortunately, I have been improving my
          English recently despite my old age (65 next month).</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">In
          the future, I am going to make everything in English. I will translate
          at least 10 more pages from the French site and review all the rest. I
          will write my programs in English. The source
          code, which may be freely copied, distributed and even modified, will
          also be released in English. Those programs are important because they validate my
          ideas. </p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">For
          instance, the computerized virtual wave medium invented by Mr. Philippe
          Delmotte is a true wave
          laboratory. I predict that all students in physics will someday make
          an intensive use of it.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
