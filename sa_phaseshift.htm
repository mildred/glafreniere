        July 2003, I found Mr. Milo Wolff's web site. I noticed that the core in

        full wavelength in diameter. I immediately wrote a computer program in order
        to check this and I soon found that the core for spherical standing

        also showed that any spherical incoming Gaussian impulse

        Surprisingly, the well known two peaks &quot;Ricker wavelet&quot; (which
        is used

        that axial standing waves are amplified, they radiate energy towards
        both sides. In the upper diagram situation, there is an inward radiation
        pressure only and both
        electrons are pushed towards each other. On the contrary, they are rather repelled
        in the lower diagram. It becomes obvious that there is an equilibrium point
        in-between, and as long as the particles are not moving very fast with
        respect to each other, they must be captured in this position. The
        electron or positron pair then becomes a quark. It is truly a <b><i>Wave
        Structure</i></b>, and it is responsible for neutrons, protons, and all
        other more or less stable particles.</font>

        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"> Excessive
        vibrations may destroy the resulting particle, though, and there is
        surely a privileged distance where this clamping effect is likely to
        occur. Please note this appears to be a gluonic field. It is not an electrostatic field because the
        electron standing waves are involved. Electrostatic forces are rather
        the result of the addition of progressive spherical waves emitted by electrons or
        positrons.</font>

        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"> Because energy is the square of amplitude, which is doubled
        there, this area basically contains four times more energy than that of
        one electron. What is more, those
        standing waves are also amplified by aether waves in the
        same manner as electrons alone are, and the resulting energy becomes additional mass.</font>

        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Finally,
        the gluonic field mass is much greater than that of one electron. It
        becomes clear that the electron pair which is responsible for the whole
        quark including the gluonic field becomes almost invisible. In addition,
        the resulting frequency is no longer that of the electron. So the
        electrostatic forces cannot work any more, but there is still some place
        for some other sort of spin, which is known to be fractional.</font>

        of the proton mass, which is 1836 times that of one
        electron, is located inside gluonic fields. They are very strong fields
        of force. The neutron contains only three
        quarks, each quark being made of two
        electrons and/or positrons only, but there is most probably an
        additional positron hidden in the middle of the proton.</font>

        the wave addition works quite differently for the electron-positron

        is the case for the the hydrogen atom whose nucleus is one proton only.
        In such a case, there is a pi/2 phase offset and the wave addition
        produces the stunning on-axis unidirectional radiation, which is

        In my opinion this pioneer should be remembered as the first person on

        What is more, he showed that matter using standing waves as bonding forces should also contract for
        this reason, and that this could explain Michelson's null result and Relativity.

        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The
        point is that Mr. Marcotte's experiment also clearly demonstrated that,
        near to the electron center, the first spherical node is one wavelength
        wide in diameter instead of the normal lambda / 2 length between two
        successive nodes. Inside the inner spherical node, the additional
        distance for a theoretical incoming and then outgoing wave is half of a
        wavelength, which finally causes the lambda / 2 phase shift. But this is
        only the mathematical point of view.</font>

        can pass through it because a standing wave node is a constant zero
        energy zone. So, a more reasonable hypothesis should
        be that waves are simply bouncing back and forth between the first and the second

          easily upgradeable, will soon become a must for opticians,
          acousticians, and radio-electricians. However, I managed to start the program on the elliptic
          configuration for both the emitter and receiver. In addition, both

          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">It

          distance from one focal point to any point of the ellipse and then to
          the second focal point is rigorously constant. This apparently
          unavoidable property led mathematicians to postulate that circular (or
          spherical for the ellipsoid reflector) waves emitted at the first
          focal point should reach the second focal point without any
          distortion.</p>

          not phase. Because amplitude is clearly higher on the left hand side,
          the central antinode at the second focal point is not circular any
          more. It is rather elliptic, and the result is an equivalent node and
          antinode offset. In addition, the characteristic &quot;partially
          standing wave&quot; behavior is easily recognizable (see <a href="sa_plane.htm">Ivanov's

          available now needs Philippe Delmotte's and Jocelyn Marcotte's virtual
          medium, which is a virtual but still highly dependable laboratory. The goal
          is to show that traveling waves penetrating a circular or spherical

        This will produce wavelets
