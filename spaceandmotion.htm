        have been discussing with him since several month about the wave
        structure of matter. He also beleive that aether exists and that matter
        is made of spherical standing waves. He was so incisive speaking on space and motion <span lang="FR-CA" style="font-family: Times New Roman; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: FR-CA; mso-fareast-language: FR; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">–</span>
        &quot;it is important&quot;, he said <span lang="FR-CA" style="font-family: Times New Roman; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: FR-CA; mso-fareast-language: FR; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">–</span>
        that I was conducted to think very intensely about it for a couple of
        weeks.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">My
        goal was to demonstrate that Poincaré and Einstein made a mistake
        using the Lorentz transformation in order to build up their version of
        Relativity. They did not admit that aether was a must and they preferred
        speaking about &quot;space contraction&quot; and &quot;time
        dilation&quot;. Definitely, this was a very weird and insane idea.&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Lorentz
        spoke about aether, matter contraction and clocks slowing down instead.
        I strongly believed that he was right. So I tried to understand what was
        wrong with his transformation formulas.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">I
        noticed that speed must be evaluated using space and time units. The
        point is that the Lorentz equations are already using space&nbsp;
        x&nbsp; and time&nbsp; t&nbsp; units, PLUS speed units and so space and
        time again. Clearly, any equation using such redundant values could not
        work properly. There should be something wrong about speed.</p>
        
        <p align="left"><b>There is no other speed then that of the light.</b></p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">I
        finally found that there is only one fundamental speed, which is the
        light speed c. This is my most recent important discovery. It has been
        named Theory of Space and Motion as a tribute to Mr.
        Haselhurst, because I probably would not have discovered this without
        his insistence.&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;Matter
        is made of waves which speed is the same as the light speed &quot;c&quot; through
        aether. From a mechanical point of view, it works using forces.
        All these forces are transmitted by the mean of waves, which speed is
        also the light speed &quot;c&quot;. And because any force is the source
        of energy, one will clearly understand why matter's wave energy must
        build itself in accordance with Einstein's famous equation :</p>
        
        <p align="center">E = mc<sup> 2</sup>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">It
        must be pointed out that Newton's equation (v is for speed) for kinetic
        energy is :</p>
        
        <p align="center">E = mv<sup> 2</sup> / 2</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">However
        this equation only shows <b><i>effective</i></b> kinetic energy. The
        total energy involved is worth the double. One can easily understand
        that a billiard ball can push another one, but it is slowed down during
        the process. This decelaration obviously need as much energy as it is
        needed for accelerating the other ball. So the total energy involved
        during the process is worth :</p>
        
        <p align="center">E = mv<sup> 2</sup></p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">It
        is a well known fact that the matter mass increases while it approaches
        the light speed. This mass increase is pure kinetic energy and it
        represents almost all of its energy for speeds very near from c. So the
        equation for kinetic energy sure is worth :</p>
        
        <p align="center">E = mc<sup> 2</sup></p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Energy
        can be seen as kinetic or mass energy. There is no difference. So
        any speed never can be seen as a slow speed. There is no &quot;v&quot;
        speed. It cannot be faster then
        the light speed either. MOTION is essentially <b><i>composite</i></b> in
        nature. It must be a
        suite of back and forth round trips or a sequence of sideways zigzag
        displacements always taking place at the speed of the light &quot;c&quot;.</p>

        is coherent with Albert A. Michelson's calculations for his
        interferometer. It turns out that a longitudinal <b><i>relative</i></b> motion
        must be <b><i>shorter</i></b>
        than the equivalent transverse motion :</p>

        a mechanical point of view, a pendulum <b><i>must</i></b> slow down
        while accelerating, because the absolute distance is increased.
        Moreover, this distance is no longer the same for a transverse or a
        longitudinal motion. The only way to cancel this difference is to
        contract the whole system on the displacement axis. Then the period
        would be the same on all x, y and z axis, but it still will be two times slower.
        Clearly, the clock will slow down.</p>

        this absolute point of view the Lorentz

        <p align="left"><b>Standing waves behave in accordance with&nbsp;

        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Moreover,
        I show in my page on <a href="standingwaves.htm">standing waves</a> that
        such waves behave exactly this way. As far as I know, this is <a href="http://www.keelynet.com/spider/b-104e.htm">Mr.
        Yuri Ivanov's</a> discovery. As Mr. Ivanov pointed out, matter must behave this way too
        because it is made out of spherical standing waves.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Lorentz
        was working on Voigt's transformation using Maxwell's equations. He was
        trying to understand why Michelson's interferometer did not reveal the
        aether wind. According to FitzGerald's idea he found that matter should
        contract itself on the displacement axis and reduce its evolution speed
        in order to cancel those effects.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Clearly,
        Lorentz
        was right. Unfortunately he was not aware of matter's wave properties.
        And he put down his transformation the wrong way because he was greatly
        influenced by his friend Henri Poincaré. Actually, the correct values
        for the Lorentz transformation are from Poincaré, as Lorentz himself
        later admitted.</p>
        
        <p align="left"><b>There is no galilean frame of reference.</b></p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Galileo's Relativity
        Principle is no longer true since Descartes. There is no moving frame of
        reference any more. Because of the Doppler effect, an also because any
        observer is transformed at high speed, any phenomenon which is not seen
        from an absolute point of view (at rest inside aether) cannot be
        observed as true. A distortion occurs. The illusion is so perfect that
        this observer can always presume that he is at rest. But <b><i>he is not</i></b>.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Descartes himself knew that aether should exist as a medium
        for the light waves. He actually discovered aether, and his system of
        coordinates definitely suppose a frame of reference at rest inside
        aether. There is no need to transpose values any more, as Lorentz did. The frame
        at rest must prevail.&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">So
        the Lorentz transformation equations should simply be seen from a geometrical
        point of view, using a&nbsp; <font size="4" face="Symbol">q</font>&nbsp;
        angle. A plane moving across the wind or a wave moving sideways would
        respect such an angle. Suppose that the aether wind is
        blowing at .866 c. This is the beta value, and the theta angle is worth
