          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">While
          I was working on this, I already knew that matter and especially
          electrons should be made of spherical standing waves. I also was aware
          that such waves could undergo the Doppler effect, allowing them to
          move freely at variable speeds. However I did not reveal this major
          discovery because I feared (I was wrong!) that a better knowledge of
          matter, considering the amazing forces involved, would lead us to a
          devastating Apocalypse. It is a well known fact that most discoveries such as
          radioactivity were always followed by more and more powerful weapons.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">I
          could never find any indication that this could be true for the wave
          nature of matter, though. So, in 2002, I wrote a book which was exempt
          of any mystery: Matter is made of Waves. It was not the case for
          another book written in 2000: The Theory of Absolute. I had to make it
          very evanescent about the wave nature of matter (it is not my
          discovery, but I was the first and I am still the only person who can
          explain all about it: electrons, matter, forces, mechanics). My goal
          was simply to restore Lorentz's Relativity, which is <b><i>absolute.</i></b>
          Although this point of view leads to the same predictions as Einstein's,
          it should be emphasized that Relativity, while it proves to be true,
          is nevertheless the result of our errors while we are recording a
          phenomenon.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">I
          discovered Mr. Milo Wolff's site in July 2003. While many observations
          appear to be correct, I must strongly disapprove some of his ideas
          here, and especially the WSM (wave structure of matter) ideology using
          philosophy in order to make scientific discoveries. This is weird. But
          Milo was right at least for one point: his
          concentric spherical standing wave showed a full
          wavelength core. Both static and Doppler models which I presented in 2002 showed
          only a
          half-wavelength core. This may seem strange, but exploring a new world
          is not obvious. I simply had not yet realized the similitude between
          the electron and the Airy disk.

          solemnly declare here that the Doppler moving electron is my

          electron can move at any speed from 0 to nearly the speed of light

          attempts in order to make him recognize that, M.

          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">I
          also showed before anyone else the correct diagrams for it.
          Unfortunately, Mr. Marcotte's formulas were missing, but I succeeded
          anyway. As a matter of
          fact, the Huygens' Principle is far more important and relevant as a
          tool, because the results are also a convincing proof that the system
          should behave this way.</p>

          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The
          electron properties are well known. The list is astounding. It is so
          small that it has no apparent dimension. Its electrostatic charge is
          negative. There is
          also a positive antiparticle, the positron, which exhibits exactly the
          same properties except for the opposite charge. Its wave properties are now a well admitted fact. It can
          accelerate, slow down and change its direction. It can act and react
          as a result of an apparent contact, but also at a distance. It
          contains intrinsic energy according to mc^2, and also kinetic energy
          according to m(gamma <font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="FR-CA" style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: FR-CA; mso-fareast-language: FR; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">–</span></font>

          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">In
          addition, the electron is the main actor for a lot of phenomena such
          as magnetic and electric fields, light and radio waves emission, and
          chemical reactions. It can stabilize itself around the nucleus to form
          an atom, and also to bind molecules together. Finally, it is a well
          known fact that electron and
          positron collisions can produce quarks and gluonic fields. This
          strongly indicates that in that case, the electrons and positrons
          involved do
          not really annihilate. They should most likely be still present inside
          the quarks and have their standing waves joined together as gluonic
          fields. This suggests that matter (or any other particle) is solely made of electrons.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">This
        is a huge responsibility for so small a particle, but the electron
        magnificently takes up the challenge. This web site explains how it is
        possible.</p>

          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">So
          the electron appears to be the equivalent of an Airy disk, but a very
          special one which aperture should be in principle that of a 360°
          infinite sphere. As seen above, one hemisphere only produces traveling
          waves, but the addition of the opposite one produces standing waves.
          This is Milo Wolff's electron. Now let's see how the Doppler effect
          should transform it.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Using Huygens' Principle, I submitted all Huygens' wavelets to a
          Doppler effect. The algorithm then becomes a bit more complicated,

          the first inventor, because square or sawtooth waves are propagating
          normally, while Delmotte's one produces some sort of heat, a local
          vibration of the &quot;aether granules&quot;. This does not mean that
          it is better. It is simply different, and this suggests that there could
          exist many options for an ideal aether. However, in both cases, sine
          waves behave normally, much like the sound propagates inside a solid

          computer programming, because he firstly had to handle the new <a href="http://fbide.sourceforge.net/category/freebasic/">FreeBASIC</a>

          and he seems to be the only person on Earth who can understand my Airy

          By March 2006, he informed me that Milo Wolff's static electron could

          increases at high speed. This proves that its energy, hence its mass
          increases. This also proves that the gain in mass according to the

          July 10, 2006, Mr. Jocelyn Marcotte (we are both French Canadians)
          succeeded in experimenting my Doppler moving electron. Even better, he used the Lorentz transformations
          in order to reproduce the Doppler effect. This shows that those
          transformations are not about a space-time distortion. They much more
          simply predict that the on-axis wavelength will be shorter, and that
          the phase will evolve along the axis. It will be retarded in the front
          of any moving wave system, producing a phase wave. Mr. Marcotte used his own
          Virtual Aether algorithm (see <a href="programmes/Ether04_Marcotte.bas">Ether04_Marcotte.bas</a>), which is
          slightly different from Mr. Delmotte's, in a 3-D space.</p>

          run over 3 GHz with RAM over 3 Go, and the program will deliver better
          results.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          my opinion, this experiment will be related in the future as a
          memorable achievement. It was the ultimate proof, showing that this
          amazing wave can exist. This event was of the utmost importance
          because the wave exhibits all of the electron properties. So it must be
          an electron. And if it is, a severe revolution in the world of physics
          is likely to occur because today's science is afflicted with a lot of

          aether waves. Traveling waves going through standing waves produce a
          lens effect, and a small part of the energy is transferred to the
          standing waves. This constant new energy allows the electron to exist
          forever.</p>

          while it is accelerating, slowing down or changing its direction, the

          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">However,
          the radiation pressure mechanism can overcome this problem. The waves
          emitted by the electron will inevitably encounter those incoming from
          all other electrons. Especially on the axis joining them, this will
          produce a very special set of standing waves. This is a <i><b>field of
          force</b></i>, which will also be amplified by aether waves. Half of
          the resulting energy is then returned and focalized directly towards
          the emitters which have created the field.</p>
        
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">My

          (source code: <a href="programmes/Ether13.bas">Ether13.bas</a>) shows
          clearly how and why this phenomenon is possible. Forget the language
          and just observe the animation. The fields of force
          are emitting true, focalized and powerful traveling waves towards the
          electron. And because the phase and the wavelength do not
          necessarily coincide, the electron will progressively adapt itself.</p>
        
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Because
          the waves amplitude is higher near the center, it turns out that half
          of the electron energy could certainly be present inside a very small
          sphere, maybe the size of an atom. There is enough space for thousands
          and even millions of wavelengths, though. The other half may expand
          inside a much wider sphere.</p>
        
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The
          amplification process can be seen like the production of an infinite
          number of Huygens' wavelets. According to Huygens, the wavelets
          addition must create a wave front wherever their phase coincide.
          Clearly, incoming wavelets can produce standing waves, but outgoing
          ones can only produce an outgoing wavefront.</p>
        
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">It
        turns out that the wavelets summation, hence new energy, is far greater
        near the center. It does not obey the square of the distance law. This
        indicates that very far from the electron, permanent standing waves
          compatible with the core phase cannot exist.</p>

        <p align="left"><b>One wave. Two particles. Four phases.</b></p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Considering
        standing waves evolving inside the elastic medium (the aether), the points of minimum
        vibration are called nodes. This is where the medium pressure remains
        normal and constant. The points of maximum vibration are rather called
        antinodes, and this is where the pressure can be negative or positive. It could also
        be lower or higher then a positive normal pressure. So standing waves
        produce nodes and
        antinodes, which are regularly spaced at every half-wavelength.
        
        </p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The
        point is that such antinodes appear <b><i>twice </i></b>per period. This
        means that while a standing wave system is producing a positive antinode
        at a given x coordinate, another system placed crosswise can rather
        produce a negative antinode there. Both systems being perfectly
        synchronized and identical, their pulsating period is not for an
        observer placed there.&nbsp;
        
        </p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">So
        this is a <b><i>relative</i></b> point of view. All electrons are
        perfectly identical, but their unique central antinode is a privileged one. The amplitude there can
        be positive while it is negative inside another one, but all the other
        antinodes will be present simultaneously.
        
        </p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">This means that while one
        core is positive,
        another one can be negative. In other words, its phase&nbsp; is pi
        shifted by respect to the other. In the meantime, all other antinodes
        are present, but their position is lambda / 2 shifted. This explains why
        two sorts of electron is possible. The electron spin does not refer to a
        mechanical rotation. It is the consequence of a <b><i>phase rotation</i></b>,
        and in order to achieve this all electrons must be perfectly synchronized.
        
        </p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">In
        addition, two times per period, such synchronized standing waves seems
        to disappear because the medium pressure is normal everywhere. This is
        called quadrature, which can be either pi / 2 or 3 pi / 2. This
        indicates that there is some place for two other particles, two sorts of
        positrons, which antinodes also appear simultaneously.
        
        </p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"> Assuming that electrons can synchronize
        themselves mutually, all positrons in the vicinity will less or more
        rapidly transform their phase and become electrons. The atomic structure
        makes it so that electrons are always nearer one from another, while
        positrons are also grouped. Moreover, the <a href="sa_protons.htm">proton</a>
        structure supposes that the three quarks should produce a pi / 2 phase
        shift in its center, making a hided positron very comfortable there.
        
        </p>
        <p align="left"><b>The spin effect.</b></p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Two
        electrons close together behave normally in spite of the spin
        difference. But up and down spin produce opposite <a href="sa_magnetic.htm">magnetic
        fields</a> when the electron standing waves are encountering the
        positron (hided inside the proton) ones. A unidirectional radiation
        appears, and the direction determines the north and south poles. This
        means that the hydrogen atom is certainly magnetic. It is a dipole, and
        the sun surface clearly proves this. However the hydrogen molecule is
        made of two hydrogen atoms. Because it is not magnetic, it should
        contain two electrons which spin is +1/2 and -1/2.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">For
        the same reason, any atom should contain an equal number of spin, which
        should be placed on opposite sides. Otherwise, the resulting atom will
        show a residual polarity which will modify its chemical properties. This
        explains Pauli's Exclusion Principle.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The
        electron spin (up and down, or +1/2 and -1/2) is the consequence of
        phase rotation. It can be either -pi/2, pi/2, 3pi/2, etc. The positron
        quadrature is rather 0 pi, pi, 2 pi, etc. The word <b><i>spin</i></b> 
        indicates a mechanical rotation, but this would suggest an axis which
        has never been demonstrated. Moreover, such a spin is unlikely to be
        possible because the electron is so small that it can be seen as a
        point. And a point simply cannot spin.</p>

          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Scientists
          should realize that even today, the electron structure and mechanism
          is still totally unknown. Most (not to say all) of physical phenomena
          such as magnetic fields remain unexplained. Facing such a situation,
          one should think a lot about it and, if possible, propose some
          hypothesis. This web site does propose a full set of them, which
          suppose that matter is made of waves.
          Because it is the only acceptable theory up to now (actually it is highly
          probable), it cannot be ignored any longer.&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">I
          suspect that scientists are&nbsp;refractory to this theory mainly
          because it does not match today's false but well admitted ideas, such
          as electromagnetic waves and photons. I think the problem is
          certitude. Why do most scientist are so confident about their
          knowledge? There should be a place for doubt. Haven't they ever heard
          of Descartes?</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">The scientific world is facing an enormous
          problem: it has gotten stuck in a blind alley. Many well admitted
          ideas are simply false, and the sum of them is an impeachment to new
          discoveries. For example, Maxwell presented in 1873 his equations on
          &quot;electromagnetic waves&quot;. Surprisingly, all scientists
          immediately agreed with that. This attitude is unacceptable. Maxwell
          just forged a set of equations. <b><i>He never showed</i></b> that
          electric and magnetic fields could really travel through space at the speed of
          light. He never explained the true nature and mechanism of electric
          and magnetic fields. And finally subsequent physicists accepted
          Einstein's idea that those fields should be packed inside photons and
          that they could move at the same speed in any frame of reference (no
          aether needed!). This is insane.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Let's
          be clear: electromagnetic waves do not exist. Fresnel tried to explain
          polarization but he failed (one more error). There is no aether
          transverse vibration. The light is made of normal traveling waves, but
          it is emitted by at least two particles. Ask any radio waves specialist. Suppose that one emitter moves in a circular motion while
          another one emits a perfectly synchronized signal. Then the
          interference pattern must undulate. The undulation plane determines
          the polarization. Moreover, the frequency is that of the undulations,
          not that of the electrons. It is a <b><i>secondary frequency</i></b>.
          In spite of the electron unique very high frequency, lower frequencies
          become
          possible on a very large spectrum up to gamma rays.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"> Maxwell's
          equations yields correct results because those electric and magnetic
          fields are virtually present inside radio waves. Because their phase
          is undulating, they can indeed produce such fields as soon as they
          encounter some matter. They will simply reproduce the same electron
          motion which was going on during the emission. Except for the square
          of the distance law, the emission and
          reception process is perfectly symmetric.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">So all happens as if
          the fields were traveling. But they are not.</p>

          true Relativity because Galileo's Relativity Principle is wrong. Let's be
          realistic: space simply cannot contract. Lorentz's
          Relativity is true, and it should be clear that the aether is not just
          a preferred frame of reference. It is the only one, it is Cartesian,
          not Galilean, and it is absolute. In addition, Relativity does not
          involve gravity, and gravity cannot bend space (did you really believe
          that?). Non Euclidian geometry is
          false. So there is no &quot;general Relativity&quot;.</p>
