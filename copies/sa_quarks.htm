        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The
        goal is to find a &quot;quark&quot;, a wave unit which can produce a
        proton or a neutron while three of them are joined. Because there are
        &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot; quarks, they should be slightly different.
        So we are looking for three quarks, albeit one must realize that most
        observations on quarks appear quite fuzzy. We cannot see a quark, and
        even worst, it is impossible to observe one alone because it is highly
        unstable. Honestly, there could be no quarks at all, but rather a wave
        system which <b><i>seems</i></b> to contain three quarks.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p align="left">The wave units should be made of only two
            electrons because they must be the simpler possible.</li>
          <li>
            <p align="left">Electrons should be capable of attracting
            themselves in spite of their charge.</li>
          <li>
            <p align="left">They should produce a gluonic field in order to
            justify this attraction effect&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
          <li>
            <p align="left">They should still radiate a &quot;colour
            charge&quot;: the four pi / 4 intermediate phases are obvious.</li>
          <li>
            <p align="left">However the phase may vary from different points of
            view, as +2/3 and -1/3 opposite mean spins.</li>
          <li>
            <p align="left">The three quarks units should be neutral because
            they can produce a neutron.</li>
          <li>
            <p align="left">However it should be positive in its centre in order
            to accept a positron and become a proton.</li>
          <li>
            <p align="left">It should show eight axis in order to explain the
            constant 8-electron external atomic shell.&nbsp;</li>
          <li>
            <p align="left">It should be capable of capturing one
            electron and produce an hydrogen atom.</li>
          <li>
            <p align="left">Many protons should be capable of attracting
            themselves in spite of their charge.</li>
          <li>
            <p align="left">This could be achieved by magnetic fields, hence the
            spin should be the same for more electrons.</li>
          <li>
            <p align="left">Many protons should capture the same number of
            electrons in different periodic atomic shells.</li>
          <li>
            <p align="left">Those shells should coincide with precise periodic
            zones in order to explain the spectral lines.</li>

        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The
        <a href="sa_mechanics.htm">wave mechanics</a> indicates that an electron
        and a positron can produce <b><i>two</i></b>  quark pairs. In the
        beginning of times, there was nothing else but electrons and positrons
        in equal quantities. This is explained in the page on a new <a href="sa_evolution.htm">Theory
        of evolution</a>. So they must have attracted themselves and produced a lot of
        quark pairs. Just one quark is highly unstable, but two pairs can join an
        produce a much more stable unit. Finally a third quark can join and
        produce a neutron.</p>
        
        <p align="left"><b>Just concentric wave diagrams.</b></p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">My
        wave mechanics indicates that moving matter behaves exactly as if it was
        perfectly at rest inside aether. Then the electron waves become
        concentric, ruling out the Doppler effect. So this page will only show
        concentric wave diagrams, which are much simpler.</p>

        central antinode diameter is worth a full

        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The
        wave mechanics page shows that electrostatic forces appear between two
        electrons or positrons while they are relatively distant. Then their
        standing wave system is weaker and the wavelets which they constantly
        emit meet, producing a very special set of plane standing waves on the
        axis. Then
        those standing waves are amplified by aether waves and the energy is
        radiated along the axis toward both particles, creating a repulsion
        effect. Moreover, while the waves are out of phase beyond both
        electrons, they destroy themselves and allow the inner waves to push
        both electrons from each other. This does not occur between an electron
        and a positron, and so they are attracted instead.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Most
        wave diagrams are showing compressed zones in white and dilated
        ones in black, allowing any intermediate gray shade. However this method
        cannot show the zero-energy zones because they are then represented by a
        medium gray. So I had to oblige the computer to darken those zones to
        black instead, making the diagrams much more revealing.&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Moreover,
        there are billions of wavelengths between those electrons and one simply
        cannot show them all. So the diagrams will show only a small number of
        waves. Let's
        repeat that we are speaking about electrostatic charges here. Then the
        so-called &quot;in-waves&quot; are absent and the electron is shown as a
        pulsating wave centre only. There are no standing waves: just outward
        waves which energy fades out according to the normal square of the
        distance law.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Observe
        that while the distance between two electrons is worth an integer
        multiple of the wavelength, the waves are adding themselves beyond each
        electron.</p>

        system. Its standing waves area is very small, but
        it constantly radiates waves which obey the normal square of the distance
        law. This means that for a given distance from the electron's core, say
        the proton's diameter (which is worth about 100 millions of electron

        two different forms, one neutral and the other one positive. The
        so-called beta decay indicated that a proton should contain a hidden

        unlikely to be possible.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">By the way, neutrinos
        from the same beta decay do not exist. The &quot;creation&quot; of this particle by Wolfgang Pauli and Enrico Fermi (from the
        Italian,&nbsp; neutrino means little neutral) reminds that of the photon, which
        does not exist either. They did not really detect this particle. They
        just wanted to explain the small energy difference, which is simply emitted as a wave

        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Augustin
        Fresnel discovered that the waves energy is worth the square of the
        amplitude. This law is one of the most well known of all, but most
        scientists still do not understand it well. For instance, the the laser
        beam produces an Airy disk which is postulated to be the result of the addition of billions of wavelets
        originating from the laser surface.
        </font> <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">However, the wavelets
        energy decreases according to the also well known square of the distance
        law. So it becomes difficult to understand why the laser energy does not
        significantly decrease until the distance has reached the &quot;junction
        point&quot;.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The
        formula for this junction point is: L = D<sup> 2</sup> / 2.44 <font face="Symbol" size="4">l</font>.
        For instance, the distance is 630 mm (about 2 feet for
        </font> <font face="Symbol" size="4">l
        </font> <font face="Times New Roman" size="4"> = 0.00065) for a one millimeter
        aperture red laser. This
        happens because the waves emitted by two electrons will add their
        amplitude (1 + 1 = 2) while the energy will rather be the square of the
        total amplitude (2 times 2 = 4).&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The
        wave energy from 2 electrons will cancel while the phase is opposite,
        but it will be squared while the phase is the same. Because the waves
        distribution is sinusoidal, this would normally end
        with a simple additive result, but there is an unusual exception on the
        axis joining two electrons. The waves are always adding themselves there.
        They never cancel inside a space which is far wider then just one wavelength. This
        space is a &quot;gluon&quot;, a <b><i>gluonic field</i></b>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">According
        to Pythagoras, the gluonic field D transverse diameter up to a lambda / 4 phase is worth D =
        2 SQRT( L) in wavelengths. It seems that the
        distance&nbsp; L&nbsp; between both electrons is worth about 100 million
        wavelengths, and this indicates that the gluonic field diameter could be worth 20000
        electron wavelengths.&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">So
        the gluonic field could be a very long 20 000 x 100 000 000 wavelengths
        prolate ellipsoid (cigar-shaped) area. Everywhere inside it, the energy is worth
        <b><i>four times</i></b> that of just one electron for the same area.
        The gluonic field also includes the standing waves beyond both
        electrons, and this space is even wider. All those standing waves must
        radiate their energy along the axis only.&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">In
        other words, most of the quark mass is that of its gluonic field and
        most of this energy is radiated along the axis. So there should be a
        strong repulsion effect along the axis as a radiation pressure, and a
        strong transverse attraction effect as a shade effect.</p>
        <p align="left"><b>The gluonic field amplification.</b></p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">On
        the one hand the electron is a standing waves system which is amplified
        by aether waves, as the result of a lens effect. On the other hand this
        gluonic field is also made of standing waves. So it should also be
        amplified by aether waves. And unlike the electron, it does not contain
        a central antinode which volume is very narrow. This volume imposes an
        amplification limit, and this limit is much larger in the case of the
        gluonic field.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">So
        the gluonic field is strongly amplified. The result should look like this:</p>

        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The
        first plane contains the gluonic fields. It shows that on-axis and off-axis
        interferences appear periodically. The on-axis interference on the right
        side is the last one. Its distance indicates the size of an atom, more
        exactly the distance between the proton and the <b><i>second</i></b>
        atomic layer.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The
        second plane shows the same on-axis interferences from the transverse
        point of view. The off-axis interferences are similar but they are not
        visible. All those
        interferences are true hyperbolas, not hyperboloids.</p>
