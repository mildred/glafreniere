  <p align="left"><b>Lorentz's original equation set.</b></p>
  <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">By 1887,
  the Dutch
  physicist Hendrik
  Antoon Lorentz (1853 – 1928) was extremely concerned about Michelson's researches.
  Naturally, his goal was not to elaborate the theory of Relativity. He was just
  trying to explain why the <a href="sa_Michelson.htm">Michelson interferometer</a>
  failed to detect the absolute motion of the Earth through the Aether. FitzGerald
  had suggested that matter contraction might explain this unexpected result. In
  1895, Lorentz found that any contraction or expansion of this apparatus
  according to his preliminary equations would end up with a null result. The
  only condition is that the light path along the displacement axis must be
  shorter than that of the transverse one. Then the transit time difference due
  to the Doppler effect is cancelled. In addition, Lorentz noticed
  that this would introduce some time effects.
        </p>
  <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Next, Lorentz
  had to determine the exact contraction value among a range of
  possibilities, considering that just one contraction value is compatible with
  the corresponding time effects. He also had to take into account a constant
  &quot;aberration&quot; ratio which was discovered by Michelson. It is a
  consequence of the Doppler effect.
        </p>
  <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">In this
  page, this aberration is assimilated to Lorentz's contraction factor
  &quot;g&quot;. Space contraction (matter contraction, actually) is among the
  basic principles of Relativity. But unfortunately, the gamma factor does not
  account for such a contraction, being larger than one. I am of an opinion that
  this anomaly is misleading. That is why I suggest replacing the gamma factor
  with Lorentz's contraction factor, which is the reciprocal: g = 1 / gamma. Its
  value is easily given if one adopts the beta normalized speed, which was
  established by Henri Poincare.
        </p>

  <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Lorentz
  and Henri Poincare worked together on this problem for ten years. They considered
  a moving electron and they tried out several contraction and time values in
  order to modify its electromagnetic fields in such a way that it would appear
  stationary. By 1901, Lorentz had already succeeded. In 1904, he finally released
  an equation set supporting his theory, albeit today's version shown below is
  somewhat different. In 1901, however, Poincare was already working on a
  Relativity principle. In 1901, in his book &quot;Electricity and Optics&quot;, he
  pointed out that the absolute motion is impossible to detect. He also admits
  at that time that Lorentz had already found that Voigt's constant
  &quot;l&quot; should be equal to unity. In 1904, Poincare's theory was exposed
  in St-Louis, USA, and it was published in 1905.</p>
  <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">It turns
  out that the &quot;Lorentz Transformations&quot; are more exactly a
  transposition of Poincare's 1905 equations.</p>

  <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Poincare
  says very clearly: &quot;The Lorentz transformations replaces the actual
  moving electron by an ideal stationary electron&quot;. This means that he
  applies the x' variable to the stationary electron, which is totally confusing.
  Hence, I propose in this page a simpler reversed equation set where x and t
  represent more logically the stationary electron. As an additional benefit,
  those &quot;transformed transformations&quot; prove to be more easily
  understandable.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>Maxwell's equations are irrelevant.</b></p>
  <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Most
  texts from <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Author:Hendrik_Lorentz">Lorentz</a>,
  <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Author:Joseph_Larmor">Larmor</a> and <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Author:Henri_PoincarÃ©">Poincare</a>
  are available on the web. Unfortunately, they all make use of complex calculus
  related to Maxwell's equations. The problem is that very few people are
  capable of dealing with those electromagnetic concepts. For instance, authors
  of books on radio-electricity are well aware that experimental results are
  very often different from theoretical ones. As a matter of fact, Lorentz
  himself wrote in 1920 that less than 20 physicists in the world had a fairly
  good knowledge of Relativity. And nowadays, it is even worse.</p>
  <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">The point
  is that Lorentz himself admitted that his equations were similar to Woldemar
  Voigt's ones, whose goal in 1887 was more simply to cancel the Doppler effect.
  I could check that those equations indeed produce this effect on <b><i>sound
  waves</i></b>, which definitely do not require Maxwell's equations. This is
  easily verifiable because one just needs to deal with sine and cosine
  functions, the results being displayable on the computer screen. For example,
  you may check this program, which analyses the effects of four different
  frequency shifts (press A, B, C or D) on the Doppler effect using Voigt's
  revisited equations.</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="programs/Doppler_Voigt_transformations.bas">Doppler_Voigt_transformations.exe</a></p>
  <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">You may
  also press any key from 0 to 9 in order to select the beta speed. Clearly,
  this is all about the Doppler effect, which is a quite simple phenomenon. It
  surely doesn't require some complicated calculi involving Maxwell's equations. </p>
  <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">In short, the use of Maxwell's equations is a major and unnecessary obstacle.

  <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">
  Frankly, it is best to stay away from them. </p>
  <p align="left"><b>Lorentz's contraction factor g and Poincare's beta
  normalized speed.</b></p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">I
        reiterate that the letter g will represent Lorentz's contraction factor,
        originally known as &quot;the aberration&quot;. Its value is given by
        the reciprocal of the well known gamma factor, which should be avoided
        because its leads to some severe misunderstandings. The factor g
        replaces the bulky Sqr(1<span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: FR-CA; mso-fareast-language: FR; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA" lang="FR-CA"><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: FR-CA; mso-fareast-language: FR; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">–(</span></font></span>v^2/c^2))
        which is present in Lorentz's equation set shown above. In addition,
        once again for the sake of simplicity, it is preferable to adopt
        Poincare's &quot;beta&quot; normalized speed, which is given by: v / c.
        In this case, one obtains c = 1 so that c squared remains 1 and may
        conveniently be removed from the equation set.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Thanks
        to those elementary adjustments, the Lorentz transformations become much
        simpler. They also become amazingly explicit, showing&nbsp; <b><i>four
        transformations</i></b> (hence the use of the plural). Two of them apply
        to space measures and two more apply to time measures.</p>

        variable should preferably refer to the unmoving system. That is why x and x' must be swapped. However, swapping
        the t and t' variables proves to be incorrect. There is no other way out:
        Voigt confused the t and t' variables. Lorentz and Poincare did not
        notice the error either because the t time is an arbitrary data which
        must be known <b><i>before</i></b> applying the transformations.
        Obviously, any arbitrary time seems to yield the correct values on paper.
        The error indeed remains hidden using only one x coordinates because the
        symmetry works. However, it does become well visible on a computer screen (as a distortion in the
        Doppler effect) when the transformations involve thousands of pixels and

  <p align="left"><b>The aether.</b></p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">The
        Lorentz Transformations apply to waves as soon as motion is to be taken
        into account. It has be seen that Voigt's version is useful in order to
        show on a computer screen how any kind of waves should experience the
        Doppler effect. The author of the computer program must be fully aware
        that the pixel coordinates are equivalent to those of a Cartesian system
        of coordinates, which is postulated to be stationary with respect to the
        wave medium. There is no place here for a so-called Galilean frame of
        reference. And I must add that the goal of the Lorentz transformations
        is not to &quot;transform space and time&quot;, which is definitely
        absurd.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"> No doubt, Lorentz was a great
        physicist. What's more, and this is of the utmost importance, Lorentz strongly believed
        in the existence of the aether when he elaborated his equations
        <font face="Times New Roman" size="4"> (I write <b><i>aether</i></b> in
        order to be respectful to Descartes, who coined the word éther from the Greek &quot;aither&quot;, the
        French acute accent being actually a second vowel)</font>. Considering that nobody ever demonstrated
        that the aether does not exist, it is rather deceiving that today's
        scientists consider this as a certainty. Definitely, the Lorentz
        transformations should be examined and tested (up to now, nobody did!) according to Lorentz's
        original concept. Otherwise they should not be named after him.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Unfortunately,
        Lorentz changed his mind later because he could not find any mechanical
        reason explaining matter contraction. According to Poincare, this
        &quot;strange property&quot; looked very much like a &quot;thumb
        snap&quot;, which in English may be translated more exactly as a
        &quot;helpful hand&quot; conveniently given by Nature in order to hide
        from us our absolute motion.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">But
        fortunately, we did find two excellent reasons for this to happen.
        
      </font>
        <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Firstly, Louis de Broglie
        discovered that matter exhibits wave properties. This is especially
        verifiable in observing the electron diffraction patterns. And secondly,
        <span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><a href="http://mirit.ru/rd_2007en.htm">Mr. Yuri Ivanov</a>  </span>
        discovered more recently that &quot;lively standing waves&quot; (let's
        call them Ivanov's waves) are undergoing a contraction. That is why it
        appears very likely that moving matter must undergo a contraction. It is
        on longer a <b><i>Deus ex machina</i></b>, that is to say an unexpected
        and improbable event which has no logical counterpart and which
        conveniently intervenes in order to fix an otherwise unsolvable issue.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Lorentz never totally abandoned the idea of
        an aether. He wrote in 1920:</p>

        abandoned at present, will once more be followed with good results, if
        only because it can lead to the thinking out of new experimental tests.
        Einstein's theory need not keep us from so doing; only the ideas about

        Lorentz had to postulate that the aether exists in order to elaborate
        his transformations. Poincare also admitted that &quot;this hypothesis
        is useful in order to explain those phenomena&quot;. Even after 1920,
        Einstein himself did not totally reject it either. Hence, the idea that
        the aether does not exist should be considered as highly suspect,
        especially because the real nature and mechanism of electromagnetic
        fields are still totally unknown today.&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">At
        all events, if you are still clinging to the idea that the aether does
        not exist, you are nevertheless invited to examine the simpler Alpha version
        of the Lorentz transformations below. It refers to a phenomenon which
        was discovered by Mr. Yuri Ivanov in 1981. I found that it is reproducible
        using an equation set which I called the Alpha transformations because
        it is the very beginning of the New Mechanics, a new science created by
        Henri Poincare.
        <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">This phenomenon </font>is highly practical,
        physical, indeed undisputable. As a matter
        of fact, it is easily reproducible and verifiable because it also applies
        to sound waves, which do need a medium such as
        air in order to propagate. And it will nevertheless lead us to
        Relativity.</p>

        <p align="center">(applies to Ivanov's Standing Waves).</p>
  <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">In
  1981, <a href="http://mirit.ru/rd_2007en.htm">Mr. Yuri Ivanov</a>   discovered
  a fundamental phenomenon which he called <i><b>lively standing waves.</b></i>
  It is a well known fact that two sets of identical plane waves traveling in opposite
  directions produce plane standing waves. However, nobody had hitherto experimented what
  would happen if wavelengths were different.</span></p>
  <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">&nbsp;Mr.
  Ivanov experimented this phenomenon using speakers and microphones in the
  presence of wind. He found that the characteristic node-antinode standing wave
  pattern was
  surprisingly moving, thus carrying the wave energy at the same speed. In this
  page, this speed is called &quot;alpha&quot;. It is normalized according
  to c = 1 using Poincare's method. Hence it is always inferior to the speed of
  light or sound.</span></p>
  <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">What's more, Mr. Ivanov discovered that the pattern was undergoing a
  contraction.</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">And
        furthermore, Ivanov's
        waves also exhibit a phase wave, which was firstly described by Louis de
        Broglie. The phase wave speed is given by the reciprocal of the alpha speed: v = 1
        / alpha so that it is always higher than the speed of light or sound.
        In this perspective, according to de Broglie, the speed of light is indeed given by the geometrical mean between the alpha speed
        (de Broglie's &quot;group&quot; speed) and the phase wave speed.</span></p>

        <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">All this is
        fundamental. It is the very basis of the Lorentz transformations and it
        leads ultimately to Relativity. Moreover, because those waves are definitely not &quot;standing&quot; any
        more, they require a
        more appropriate name. That is why I suggest that they should be named
        &quot;Ivanov's waves&quot;. Considering that Mr. Ivanov is clearly the
        discoverer, he also deserves it because he soon realized that he was in
        touch with something really important. He calls it &quot;rythmodynamics&quot;.
        He especially showed that, on the only condition that chemical bonds are
        performed by standing waves, matter and especially the Michelson
        interferometer must contract. This phenomenon explains Michelson's null result.
        Unfortunately, Ivanov did not agree with Lorentz and Poincare, who had preferred
        a contraction according to g instead of g squared. He ended up with his
        own &quot;Ivanov Transformations&quot;, which apply only to acoustic phenomena.</p>

        speed of Ivanov's standing waves. </span>

        the arithmetic vs. geometric mean wavelength ratio. The y and z variables
        are useless here because we are dealing with plane waves only. Yet, they
      are still useful in order to reproduce the transverse &quot;lively
      standing waves&quot; shown farther below, which obey the same alpha
      transformations.

        <p align="left"><b>What do the variables stand for?</b></p>
  <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
  Alpha transformations are basically Lorentz's ones, but their application
  differ significantly because the x and t variables refer neither to matter nor electromagnetic fields.

        more specifically refer to </span></font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"> the geometric mean of

        </span></font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">units. The t

  produce the same arbitrary wavelength.</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">One
  may rather use the arithmetic mean, but this would require the use of g
  squared instead of g. Because a choice must be made, it appears preferable to resolutely
  cling to the geometric mean wavelength.
  Lorentz's contraction factor may be given by the arithmetic vs. geometric mean
  wavelength ratio. The alpha speed may be deduced from the wavelength
  ratio R. In this case, all three transformations
        Alpha, Beta and Gamma become identical:</span></p>

        note that the Alpha transformations apply to acoustic and optical waves
        as well. After all, the goal is merely to check out what occurs when two
        wave trains </span><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"> whose
        wavelength differ </span></font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">are
        moving on two coincident paths. Starting from scratch, and accounting
        only for those two basic wavelengths, the conclusion nevertheless leads to
        Relativity. This is quite a giant step for such a little effort. But even though it is
        really not complicated, the scientific world had to wait until Ivanov's experiments
        in 1981.</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Unfortunately, Mr. Ivanov ended up with

        are nonetheless useful because they reproduce the regular acoustic
        Doppler effect. As a matter of fact, it is a special case of the Voigt transformations
        where k = g instead of Lorentz's unnecessary k = 1. The bad news is that
        Ivanov's transformations do not apply to the electron, whose frequency
        slows down according to g. For this reason, they do not apply to matter
        and hence, they cannot explain Relativity.</span></p>

  This is a major breakthrough because the use of Lorentz's equations is no
  longer limited to Relativity. In this case, they merely apply to a quite
  ordinary phenomenon. We are not dealing with some hypothetic and

        insist on the geometrical aspect of those highly Pythagorean and
        Cartesian transformations. On the contrary, today's Relativity is
        desperately esoteric. In order to avoid skidding again on a road which
        proves to be particularly slippery, one must realize that the basis of
        all this is Pythagoras' theorem.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Below, the hypotenuse
        length is normalized to one. It is the equivalent of the speed of light,
        which was also normalized to one by Henri Poincare in order to simplify
        Lorentz's equations. Thus, c = 1 and alpha (or beta) = v/c. The lengths
        or the adjacent sides now represent Lorentz's contraction factor g and
        the alpha speed. However, quite surprisingly, c and g remain
        proportional to the arithmetical mean and the geometrical mean of the
        two interleaved waves.</p>

  In this example, the two interleaved plane waves traveling in opposite
  directions measure respectively 50 and 150 pixels. The x variable must be
  established according to the geometrical mean wavelength, hence 86,6 pixels.
  The Alpha equations will then indicate the correct x' coordinate. They will
  also indicate the correct t' phase (which may be used in order to establish
  the time)&nbsp; for this point. This means that in the beginning (that is to
  say, when t = 0), x' and t' are simply given by:</span></p>

        in such a way that a phase wave (de Broglie's) appears. In the case of
        matter, this phenomenon must rather be interpreted as Lorentz's famous

        <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Please
        bear in mind that the unique function of the Alpha Transformations is to
        reproduce Ivanov's standing waves on a computer screen. For example,
        let's suppose that one needs just one image of this phenomenon. The x coordinates are given
        in wavelength units (i</span><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">n the
        example shown above, lambda = 86.6 according to </span></font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">the
        geometrical mean). So, x = 1 means a distance of 86.6 pixels to the
        origin. Considering that the t units represent the wave period (i. e.
        the pulsation phase), which is periodic in nature, this distance x = 1
        indicates that the period is also t = 1 (constant t = 0 at the origin). This is
        possible because there are no y or z coordinates, which would add to the
        actual distance. Please note that the t variable does not represent
        Lorentz's time, albeit accurate clocks indeed use an oscillation period
        in order to establish the time.</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Each
        pixel needs specific x and t variables so that an array of variables (one dimension only
        here) is required. Finally, in order
        to display this arbitrary untransformed wave on the computer screen, one
        must convert this t period into radians:</span></p>
  <p align="center"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">x =

  * pi * t</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">&nbsp;
        If x = 100 pixels, one obtains: radian = 1.1547 * 2 * pi = 7.255. The
        wave amplitude there is given by: sin(radian) = 0.826. It is nil at x = 0
        and 1 at x = lambda / 4 (quadrature). Because we are dealing with plane
        waves, the same amplitude may be repeated vertically on a 50x100 pixel
        stripe, for example. Each pixel need a different calculus. I prefer
        displaying waves in black when amplitude is nil and in white when
        amplitude is maximum. In order to identify positive and negative
        amplitude, it seems best to represent positive&nbsp;&nbsp; using emerald
        green (regular green plus 50% blue) and magenta red (regular red plus
        50% blue). The goal is to remove the annoying yellow dominant color and,
        most important, the wave behavior is more easily interpreted this way.
        One may rather use yellow and blue, but the yellow color is much brighter
        than blue.&nbsp;</span></p>

        48, depending on the required number of images per cycle. Then the overall period will
        reach a full cycle after 48 images. During this time, the waves
        will have traveled 86.6 pixels whatever their real wavelength.</span></p>

        transverse &quot;lively standing waves&quot;.</b></p>
 <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">It
 was shown in the page on <a href="sa_plane.htm">plane standing waves</a>
 (Ivanov's waves) that transverse standing waves theoretically contain two
 tilted sets of traveling waves whose wavelength is equal. Thus, their geometrical mean
 wavelength is no longer required. Because they are tilted to a theta
 = arc sin(v/c) angle, their direction is not truly opposite so that both wave
 trains are constantly following the system. The wave-fronts being tilted, the
 wavelength as measured on a transverse axis seems longer.</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">However,
        applying the Alpha Transformations to the stationary system still
        produces the equivalent moving system. The wavelength of reference may
        be that of the
        stationary system. In addition, one must use Lorentz's equations: y' =
        y; z' = y in order to deal with transverse axes. Surprisingly, the
        transverse wavelength remaining constant, the frequency theoretically
        slows down. But this is not mandatory because one may prefer considering
        the regular Doppler effect. In this case, there is no frequency shift
        and a wavelength contraction occurs transversally according to Lorentz's factor.</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Here,
        the system alpha speed is rather difficult to establish because the
        phase wave is the only visible structure. It looks somewhat like a
        checkerboard but it is more or less distorted because of the theta
        angle. This phenomenon occurs because of a scissor effect. Here too, the
        phase wave is moving faster than the speed of the waves: v = 1 / alpha.</span></p>

  simultaneously longitudinal and transversal standing waves, one obtains a
  fairly good idea of how a moving electron should behave. Ivanov's standing
  waves indeed indicate that the electron consists of spherical standing waves.
  This idea was proposed by Mr. Milo Wolff around 1980. By 2002, in my book
  &quot;Matter is made of waves&quot;, I myself had found that such a system
  should undergo the Doppler effect in order to move. And today, it turns out
  that the electron is undergoing an unusual Doppler effect according to the
  Beta Transformations (see below).</span></p>

        following argument is fundamental : if matter is made of standing waves,
        or more practically on condition that chemical bindings are involving
        the electron wavelength, then any moving material structure obviously
        contracts according to Lorentz's contraction factor. Additionally,
        moving clocks must display slower seconds and exhibit a time shift. This
        is the absolute effect of motion on matter, and it depends strictly on
        the speed of its wave structure with respect to the aether. Lorentz's
        absolute point of view proves to be correct. Those effects <b><i>are not</i></b>
        relative. They are recorded in a quite surprising way by a moving
        observer, though. That is why Poincare and Einstein, who were
        theoretically wrong, finally ended up with correct predictions
        anyway.&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Similarly, let's
        suppose that we are observing two galaxies moving away from the Milky
        Way at the same 0.5 speed and in opposite directions. This is obviously
        because both ones must exhibit the same 1.732 redhift. However, it might
        also be because one galaxy is stationary while the other one is moving
        at 0.8 c. In this case, the Milky Way speed should be 0.5 c. The
        calculus being identical, and considering only the redshift, it is quite
        impossible to determine which hypothesis is the correct one. Actually,
        there are many more side effects such as a contraction and a time shift.
        But surprisingly, they all contribute to the same sublime mystification.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"> This is the most stunning
        application of the alpha speed. For example, using the Hertz test, the
        observer would indeed obtain equal wavelengths from both electrons or
        galaxies. Below is the video showing a similar situation with a beta speed of 0.5 and an
        alpha speed of 0.2679.&nbsp;</span></p>

        today's sophisticated instruments, this phenomenon is easily verifiable
        right now using much slower alpha and beta speeds. The point is that
        most astronomers still believe that Relativity doesn't apply to distant
        galaxies. They prefer relying on the theory of the expansion of the
        universe. According to them, our world should expand much the same way a
        raisin pudding does in the oven. The raisins distance to one another
        increases proportionally so that, using the coordinates of a small group
        of raisins, it would be impossible to detect where is the center of the
        whole pudding.</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Well,
        they are wrong! Our universe being obviously in expansion, the Big Bang
        must be relativistic. This
        statement will soon be demonstrated. My page on the <a href="big_bang_relativiste.htm">Relativistic
        Big Bang</a> is still available only in French, but you may already examine the
        tables, graphics and videos because most of them are in English. For
        example, according to Mr. Saul Perlmutter's observations, the expansion
        of the universe is speeding up. This conclusion will prove to be false because the
        Hubble constant does not take the Lorentz contraction into
        account. There are far more galaxies over .9 c than under 0.1 c because
        they contract, and this includes the distance to one another. This is no
        raisin pudding. As a matter of fact, relying on the Hubble constant,
        which doesn't account for the Lorentz contraction, the true distance of a very fast and distant
        supernova is incorrectly recorded so that it is no longer consistent
        with its constant brightness.</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Mr.
        Perlmutter had to put forward his conclusion because of the surprising
        results of his researches. It was indeed a brilliant quest. Some day,
        however, astronomers will admit their error. Then Mr. Perlmutter will

        always inferior to 1. In addition, c squared as 1 * 1 conveniently
        remains 1. Poincare claims that those equations were
        elaborated by Lorentz and he names them after Lorentz. One may
        doubt this, though, because Poincare was desperately humble. I suspect that this

        is

      <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">According to Lorentz
      and Poincare, inertia increases according to the speed in such a way that
      the speed of light is unattainable. For example, let's consider an
      observer who is already moving at half of the speed of light. From his
      point of view, he is stationary so that he may decide to accelerate in the
      same direction to half of the speed of light. But if it was true, he would
      then move exactly at the speed of light, which is impossible.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Knowing this, Poincare
      elaborated the following equation:</p>
    <p align="center">beta'' = (beta + beta') / (1 + beta * beta')</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">According to this
      equation, the observer would finally move at 80% of the speed of light.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">To be perfectly logic,
      an astronaut who is already moving at 0.5 times the speed of light as seen
      from Earth should acknowledge that he is indeed moving that fast because
      he experienced considerable acceleration effects. Thus, the Earth is
      definitely a preferred frame of reference because its average speed (and
      consequently, his measure units) did not change. That is why Lorentz's
      Relativity appears preferable to Einstein's one.</p>

  <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">The <a href="sa_scanner.htm">Time Scanner</a> 
  is the perfect tool for displaying a situation as seen by the moving observer
  B, who cannot detect his motion and may consider that he is stationary. The
  observer B is unconsciously performing the Lorentz transformations, that is to
  say, replacing the actual
  moving electron by an ideal stationary electron. The Scanner is also capable
  or transforming an unlimited number of transformations in a single operation,
  which is quite impossible to do using Einstein's Relativity because of
  incompatible measures. Additionally, the red scale doesn't transform. This
  shows that considering a fabulous &quot;space-time transformation&quot; is
  unnecessary, indeed ridiculous.</p>
  <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">The Time Scanner
  reproduces the Lorentz transformations because it scans a moving scene at the
  phase wave speed, which is given by: 1 / alpha. Obviously, any moving observer
  receives the light waves incoming from the front before those incoming from
  the rear. It is useless to look beyond this simple fact: a moving observer
  cannot record a moving scene correctly because of this. That is why he cannot
  detect the Doppler effect in his own environment; conversely, he does detect a
  Doppler effect in waves which are exempt of such an effect.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>The Time Scanner is a powerful tool.</b></p>
  <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">The Time Scanner is
  capable of performing multiple transformations whatever the direction or the
  speed of an item. This is possible on condition that each item is already
  transformed before undergoing a second transformations. For example, the
  center of the rotating gear shown on the left below is stationary. However,
  because the external part is moving at 0.866 times the speed of light, its
  elements are contracted to half of their normal size. The circular black dots
  are similarly contracted so that they now appear elliptic.</p>
        
  <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">The scanning process
  transforms the whole scene so that it appears quite different on the right
  part of the animation shown on the right below. Now, the center is moving at
  0.866 times the speed of light. The upper part of the gear still doesn't move
  faster than the speed of light, though, as a result of Poincare's law of speed
  addition. 
        
    </p>
        
  <p align="center">beta'' = (beta + beta') / (1 + beta * beta')&nbsp; = (0.866 +
  0.866) / (1 + 0.866 * 0.866) = 0.9897.</p>
  <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">And finally, knowing that
  the t' time indicates that any material event occurs later in the front of a
  system, the upper section of the gear shown on the right below is moving
  slower than the lower section in order to be consistent with this time effect.</p>

  contract the way Mr. Ivanov showed in 1981. That is why matter contraction
