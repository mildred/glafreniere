        The

  cancel the Doppler effect on Maxwell's equations in a moving frame of
  reference. Lorentz and Poincare used them in order to recover the moving electron the way
  it appears in a
  stationary frame of reference. However, one may reverse Lorentz's equations
  (actually Poincare's simpler set using c = 1 and beta = v / c) to
  obtain the opposite effect:

      It should be pointed
      out that these new inverted equations are mainly intended to transform a
      stationary emitter into a moving one. This produces a Doppler effect. In
      this case, the Cartesian coordinates x, y et z stand for wavelength and
      the t variable stands for the wave period in 2 * pi units. Their purpose
      is definitely not to transform space and time. The original version was
      supposed to correct the Doppler effect instead, and this is exactly what
      Woldemar Voigt had in mind in 1887.

      However, it becomes
      clear that Voigt's initial equations were wrong for many reasons. His
      constant was discarded by Lorentz, but it may still be useful in order to
      obtain the normal Doppler effect. In this case, its value equals g and it
      should divide the product g * t in the t' equation, not multiply it
      (compare Poincare's version above to my version below). It was a serious
      error. In addition, one must use the plus sign for the x equation and the
      minus sign for the t' one, yet this may be just an anomaly related to
      Maxwell's equations. And finally, because the x and t variables stand for
      the moving system coordinates, the original equation set creates an
      unnecessary and incompatible new frame of reference. Below is the
      corrected and inverted equation set:

      In the case of the normal Doppler effect, the k constant
equals g and the frequency is unchanged.

      <p align="center">

      Consequently,
        any Doppler effect involving light or radio waves such as those emitted
        by a satellite supposes that the frequency is slower according to g,
        unless it is corrected afterwards. It is undoubtedly a relativistic
        effect. For example, if&nbsp; the observer is traveling inside the
        satellite, he is totally unable to detect the Doppler effect in spite of
        the fact that it is easily detectable on the earth's surface. This
        occurs because he himself is transformed according to Lorentz.

      Those

        Doppler effect. And because they were wrongly used as a mathematical
        artifice whose effect was to transform space and time, I had to correct
        them. The equation set shown below is simply about a special Doppler
        effect involving a slower frequency. It just transforms the wavelength
        and the wave period, not space and time. It is not a theory, is is a

      My
          <a href="sa_scanner.htm">Time Scanner</a> is capable of accelerating
          the whole system where emitters and material bodies are moving at
          different speeds, on condition that they are already transformed.
          Here, it is accelerated to 50% of the speed of light to the right.
          However, C and C' are already moving to the right at this speed, and
      hence their new speed should be the speed of light. But Lorentz and
          Poincare discovered that no material body is capable of reaching the
          speed of light. This is why their resulting speed is only .8 c,
          according to Poincare's law of speed addition which is given by:

      In
          my opinion, such a magnificent harmony should leave nobody unfeeling.
          Now, thanks to Lorentz, Relativity can be explained. There are no
          paradoxes any more. All is clear and logical.

          the one hand, it becomes possible to display more than two

      On
          the other hand, a preferred stationary frame of reference may be
          designated as a convention. It should allow all observers to have a
          better image of their situation. Ideally, it is the one whose speed is
          intermediate, for instance the red scale as seen from A and B.
          Surprisingly, this red scale does not transform because its
          intermediate speed (not exactly .25 c because of Poincare's law of
          speed addition) is simply inverted after undergoing the acceleration.
          Its speed being the same, its contraction remains the same, so that A and B can adjust its length when they
          meet (they must consider that they are moving in opposite directions
          at the same speed). They can also adjust its clock rate so that it stubbornly displays the &quot;absolute&quot;
          time on condition that is is placed where x = 0 when A and B meet and
          on condition that they synchronize all clocks according to t = 0 when
          they meet, too. The time shift is
          inverted everywhere else because the red scale is stopped, then
          accelerated at the same speed in the opposite direction.

      All
          becomes perfectly clear. The red scale length does not change and the
          clock displays the absolute time on condition that A and B,&nbsp; A
          and C, or B and C (two of them only) designate an intermediate one as
          a preferred Cartesian frame of reference. Thus, there exists a
          situation in which space and time remain constant. To put it even more
          clearly, as Euclid, Galileo, Descartes and Newton always thought, <b><i>space
          and time do not transform.</i></b>

      In
          practice, Einstein's theory of Relativity appears inapplicable.
          Establishing a preferred frame of reference is advantageous. The
          present demonstration indicates that many of them are possible but
          that some of them are much better. Only Lorentz's version of Relativity
          allows such a choice. It should be pointed out that all this cannot be
          explained without the presence of the aether. Even if it cannot be
          detected, all happens as if it exists. It is imperative that the speed of light
      is related to it.

      The
          Lorentz transformations indicate that all this happens <b><i>solely</i></b>
          because of the Doppler effect. This strongly suggests that matter is
          undergoing the Doppler effect. Matter behaves like waves do. Lorentz's
          Relativity indicates that matter consists of waves
          propagating at the speed of light. Such waves need a medium, the
          aether, so that finally, our material world is nothing but the aether...

      It
          turns out that the Lorentz
          transformations are leading us well beyond Relativity. Now, we are dealing
          with matter mechanics, more accurately the Wave Mechanics.

      The
      goal of this page is to show that Lorentz's Relativity is easily
      explainable. It becomes possible to show why such phenomena are possible.
      Unfortunately, Lorentz never released a complete version of his ideas like
      Einstein did. More or less recently, many authors tried to promote them
      but they frequently deviate into erratic opinions such as
      faster-than-light speeds. They obviously forget that Lorentz himself found
      that inertia, and hence matter mass increases according to its speed in such a
      way that it would be infinite at the speed of light.

      This
      is why I am explaining Lorentz version of Relativity the way he himself
      would have done. As far as I know, this page is fully compatible with
      Lorentz's ideas, at least around 1904. It is by no means revolutionary.

      It
      should be emphasized that Lorentz never doubted the existence of an aether
      until his death, which occurred in 1928, and hence many years after Einstein's
      theory triumphed. Unlike Poincare, he was sure that there should exist a preferred
      frame of reference. He was convinced that matter truly contracts and that
      moving clocks are displaying slower seconds along with a &quot;local
      time&quot;. Such clocks cannot show the &quot;true time&quot;.

      To
      put it clearer, Lorentz never proposed an absurd &quot;space-time&quot;
      transformation. Poincare was much less rigorous. He rejected matter
      contraction. He thought that optical phenomena were only relative and he
      wrote that Lorentz's hypothesis was not satisfactory. He even wrote that
      the aether might some day be considered useless.

      Below
      are two quotes from Lorentz which were written several years after 1904.
      They indicate that Lorentz had finally given up his previous concept and
      accepted much of Poincare's and Einstein's ideas. However, they are very
      clear on Lorentz's 1904 theory:

        is all about mystification where the Doppler effect hides from our eyes what
        is really going on. This can easily be explained on the condition that matter and
