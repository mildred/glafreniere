        the absolute speed) must be taken into account. Two billiard balls

        electrons inside atoms or molecules come much closer than protons.
        Mostly there is an electrostatic negative force hence a repulsion

        problem mostly arises because of the mass increase. In addition, any
        observer may consider himself at rest in accordance with the law of
        Relativity. From an absolute point of view, he is not though. This
        observer may look at two billiard balls which are both moving, and so
        there are three different speeds involved.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Because
        of its reciprocity, one simply cannot use Einstein's Relativity in order
        to calculate <b><i>three</i></b> moving frames of reference
        simultaneously. A contradiction immediately appears. For the same
        reason, Henri Poincaré's symmetrical equations are useless. The best
        example would be two electrons traveling at .9999c in opposite
        directions inside a synchrotron. From the collider point of view, their
        relative speed obviously can reach almost two times the speed of light,
        and this is impossible according to Relativity.</p>

        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">There
        indeed is a Lorentzian Relativity, but Lorentz neglected to word it.
        Nobody did until many recent studies made it suddenly reappear. I
        strongly aver that it is the correct one. The action and reaction
        problem demands Lorentz's version of Relativity, not Poincaré's nor
        Einstein's. Then one can examine the transformation values for two
        moving bodies and finally determine how they will act and react.</p>

        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&quot;Any
        action produces a simultaneous reaction proportional to the wave energy
        undergoing the Doppler effect, and in the direction opposite to the

        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Some
        waves can exert a negative action, hence an attractive force. Gravity,
        for example, the shade effect, opposite electrostatic charges, etc.
        Then the reaction is also negative. For mechanical reasons, a true
        attraction effect is impossible and all true forces are positive. An
        attractive force is actually a positive force due to incoming waves from
        the opposite direction.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Because
        of the Doppler effect, action and reaction are not really simultaneous;
        the waves' relative speed is no longer the same in opposite directions.
        But from the observer's point of view, it seems to be the same.
        Lorentzian Relativity shows that the clocks do not indicate the same
        time along the displacement axis, producing a <b><i>virtual simultaneity</i></b>.</p>

      is doubled and this kinetic energy is worth exactly its mass at rest.
      Moreover, this mass as energy does not need to be stopped during a
      collision, and so one must establish a new equation according to

        then its mass at rest. The energy needed in order to stop such a small
        part of the projectile is negligible, and so most of the kinetic energy
        becomes fully effective. In such a case it is doubled: </p>

    the material body approaches the speed of light, its kinetic energy is

    <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">So
    matter is nothing but canned energy, and energy as well as inertia
    definitely can be evaluated in grams. This means that units such as the

        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"> Poincaré
        showed that any radiation contains energy, hence an equivalent mass
        which can be evaluated in grams. He was also well aware that any
        radiation could exert a radiation pressure. However, matter only is
        subject to this pressure in accordance with its inertia..</p>
        
    <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">All
    forces including gravity are caused by waves. Because the radiation pressure
    is effective on matter standing waves only, gravity cannot bend the light
    path. We know very well that the light does deviate near the sun, but one
    surely can explain this phenomenon in a different way. I presume that the
    solar wind or interstellar particles could be involved.</p>

        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">In
        order to avoid losses, one can imagine an orbiting metal box containing
        100% vacuum and hundreds of such moving rubber balls which are
        postulated to be absolutely lossless. If the box is accelerating, those balls
        become faster in the direction of motion. Conversely, they become slower
        backward. They undergo a sort of Doppler effect, but the wave
        contraction or dilation is reverted. The balls become more distant from
        each other in the direction of motion. This effect is cancelled by the
        balls speed, which is faster. When they are bouncing on the box surface,
        they communicate their kinetic energy to the box.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Let's
        consider that the box itself has no mass and no inertia. This phenomenon
        may explain why such a moving box will go on moving. It will indeed
        explain inertia. As seen above, the active mass waves are pushing on the
        electron's core this way, explaining both its speed and inertia.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Finally,
        lets suppose that a second box hits the first one. During this process
        there is no box surface between them. Then the balls will move freely
        from one box to another; they will push on the boxes opposite surface.
        This is the equivalent of the radiation pressure. Moreover a certain
        number of balls will definitely be transferred to the first box. This is
        the equivalent of the increase in mass.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Basically
        and mechanically, the active and reactive mass work like this. But
        such a wonder can only be achieved by waves. Once again, this strongly
        indicates that matter is made of waves.</p>
        
        <p align="left"><b>The speed of light is an insuperable limit.</b></p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The
        active mass, hence the total mass trends toward infinite while a
        material body approaches the speed of light. This means that Poincaré
        was amazingly right in 1904 when he stated that the speed of light is an
        insuperable limit.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Many
        people misapprehend that some phenomena involve speeds faster
        then the speed of light, but they are wrong. On the one hand, matter can
        approach the speed of light, but it simply cannot reach it. On the other
        hand, all forces are transmitted by aether waves, whose speed is
        constant and equal to that of light.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Firstly,
        action and reaction implies simultaneous effects, and this may induce an
        error.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Secondly,
        one can also act on some invisible and unknown intermediate field such
        as an electromagnetic one. This field is made of plane standing waves between
        two electrons. It may be considered as virtual matter which is fully
        subject to the radiation pressure even when those electrons are very
        distant from each other. Clearly, while acting on this field, one will
        obtain a <b><i>simultaneous</i></b> effect on both electrons, but this
        effect will seem to have happened <i><b>instantly</b></i>.&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Because
        photons do not exist, one cannot affirm that those photons may have
        changed suddenly and simultaneously well after the light has been
        emitted. One must realize that light is transmitted without any
        change only inside a vacuum. As soon as it encounters matter, which may
        be transparent as well, some new light is constantly created which
        interferes with the previous one. Its polarization or its phase may certainly
        be modified during the propagation process.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">So
        any instantaneous action at a distance is impossible. Some experiments
        may indicate that it is possible, but they surely have been
        misinterpreted.</p>
