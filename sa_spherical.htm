        phrase &quot;standing waves&quot; is misleading because such
        waves can move. Then the node and antinode pattern undergoes a contraction according to the Lorentz
        transformations. It is clearly visible in the animation shown above.
        Please observe that the first black antinode near the center is
        contracted horizontally as well as subsequent layers. The faster they
        move, the more they become elliptic. But they never contract
        transversally.</span><p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="FR-CA">Exactly

<p align="left"><b>The most ignored science.</b></p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">There
        was almost no practical information about spherical standing waves on
        the net, except for <a href="http://members.tripod.com/mwolff/">
Milo Wolff's site</a>. So I had to develop the whole science by myself. It was worth the effort because I could
        finally explain matter
and all forces. I would like to give a special thanks to MM. Serge Cabala, Philippe Delmotte,
Anselme Dewavrin and Jocelyn Marcotte, among others, who supported and helped me
        in this enterprise. I suppose that some ancient pioneers
did find interesting equations and properties in the past, but up to now there
        was very few evidence of them.<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The
wave science is the most ignored and scorned of all. It is
hard to explain because nuclear physicists know since many decades that matter
exhibits wave properties. Clearly, such waves cannot be plane. They should be
spherical, and more likely spherical standing waves. In addition, because matter
        can move, a Doppler effect should occur.&nbsp;<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">This
is quite <b><i>obvious</i></b>.<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">If

show them.<p align="left"><b>The unmoving concentric

        <b><i>are not</i></b> made of traveling waves. It is a totally different
        wave system
        which behaves in accordance with Hooke's law.</span><p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="FR-CA">For
        calculation purposes, such waves can indeed be considered as two sets of
        waves traveling in opposite directions. This is a very useful method for computer programs, and I used it for the
        diagrams shown above.</span><p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="FR-CA">However,
        one must observe what is really going on inside the medium substance when standing waves are present.</span><p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="FR-CA">For
        instance, using a loudspeaker, one can produce standing waves inside a
        pipe. The traveling waves penetrate inside the pipe, and on condition
        that the wavelength is compatible, a <b><i>resonance</i></b> is obtained. This occurs
        because the pipe ends act like screens and do not allow all of the energy
        to get out in just one pulse.</span><p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="FR-CA">Turning
        off the loudspeaker will not make the resonance stop immediately. Theoretically,
        a lossless system (no heat or energy loss) with both ends hermetically closed would
        continue to vibrate eternally. The air is simply compressed inside antinodes, then the pressure energy is transferred into
        kinetic energy, and so on. The same process occurs for lossless
        springs moving back and forth, as predicted by Hooke's law: the
        extension is proportional to the force. The point is: there are no more
        traveling waves there. Just standing waves. Especially, nodes are
        constant zero energy points, thus they are incompatible with traveling
        waves.</span><p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="FR-CA">One
        may need incoming traveling waves in order to establish standing
        waves, but they are no longer needed once the system is well
        established.</span>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="FR-CA">Additionally, if some energy is actually radiated, it may
        be replaced by amplification. This is especially true for electronic
        oscillators.</span>
        <p align="left"><b>The electron is a pulsating wave system.</b></p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="FR-CA">For
        the same reason, electrons must have
        been created in the past using incoming waves. Such a situation is not likely to
        happen because aether waves frequency and phase very rarely coincide for
        a given point, but
        it is still possible. One chance out of billions and billions.</span><p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="FR-CA">However,
        once it has been created, the electron can remain stable because its
        standing waves are constantly amplified by aether waves. This can be
        explained by a lens effect. For example, objects seen above a fire
        become more or less blurred because the speed of light is not the same
        for cold and hot air. For the same reason, the sound itself will also be
        scattered above a fire. Actually, any sound wave is surely scattered by
        spherical standing waves made of sound because this modifies the air
        density.</span><p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="FR-CA">This
        means that in-phase incoming waves are not needed any more.</span></font>
        <span lang="FR-CA"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">
        The electron just needs constant and powerful waves incoming from all matter in the universe, whose phase or wavelength may be different. Then

        pi / 2 phase offset in the center expands all the spherical waves to an
        additional lambda / 4 position. It is of the utmost importance because
        those waves encounter those incoming from another electron or positron
        and produce the field of force shown above.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Then
        the field of force itself is amplified because of the same lens effect.
        As a result, and especially because more electrons in the vicinity truly
        act like stroboscopes, a very strong wave beam
          converges back towards electrons or positrons which caused them. I could
          check that such a convergent beam should produce an Airy disk, just
          like most convergent beams except apodized ones. One must also
          remember that the Airy disk is only the diffraction pattern at the
          focal plane. It is called the Fraunhofer diffraction whose distance is
          infinite for the laser, but the whole
          diffraction pattern anywhere else between the source and the Airy disk is
          called the Fresnel diffraction.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The
          pattern is different whether the source is plane or spherical. When
          two electrons come very close together, their standing waves may add
          constructively even in the area beyond them. Then they radiate an Airy disk
          exactly in their center. This transforms the whole system into a quark
        surrounded with a powerful gluonic field where forces
          involved are enormous and quite different. In addition, the phase in the center may
          be compatible with the positron's quadrature. So the resulting system is
          no longer negative: it becomes neutral. Then three quarks placed crosswise
          on the three Cartesian axes become a neutron,
          which may finally transforms into a proton if a positron is captured in the
          center.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The
          point is: the on-axis wave period explains how <b><i>radiation

          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">One
          can apply the same reasoning to the 2-D Circular Wave Generator, which
          phase offset in the center is only pi / 4. Using the Huygens
          principle, and also the Virtual Aether, Mr. Marcotte and I already
          showed that the 2-D central antinode exhibits a 3 / 4 lambda diameter.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">So
        formulas are different. Firstly, the core correction threshold is pi /
          2 instead of pi:</p>
 <p align="center"><span lang="FR-CA" style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: FR-CA; mso-fareast-language: FR; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"><font size="4">If
          x &lt; pi / 2 Then x = x + (pi / 4) * (1

          (2 * x / pi)) ^ 2</font></span> </p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Secondly, waves are expanded to an additional lambda / 8 position,
          not lambda / 4, and
          amplitude fades according to the square root of the distance. So Mr.
          Marcotte's formula must be modified this way:</p>
          <p align="center"><span lang="FR-CA">y = sin(x <font face="Times New Roman">+
          pi / 4 <span lang="FR-CA" style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: FR-CA; mso-fareast-language: FR; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">–</span></font>
        t) / sqr(x)</span>
          </p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"> I elaborated those
        formulas on Oct. 2, 2007. This program shows that they produce very smooth outgoing
        waves:</p>

        <p align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">According
        to the diagram below, the core amplitude is higher for 2-D circular <b><i>standing</i></b>

        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="FR-CA">Spherical
        standing waves will be very useful in the future for a lot of
        applications. Up to now, scientists are definitely not aware that they
        can especially build up enormous pressures inside the central
        core.&nbsp;</span><p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="FR-CA">In
        addition, microwaves emitted from the inner surface or a sphere produce
        a similar pattern. They can build up huge quantities of energy focused inside
        a very small spherical core. And this energy may be recycled if the sphere
        internal surface is metallic.</span>
        <p align="center"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>
        <p align="center"><b>THE ACOUSTIC THERMONUCLEAR PLANT</b></p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="FR-CA">The
        point is: this small core is the perfect place for thermonuclear fusion,
        because both heat and pressure are needed to transform hydrogen,
        deuterium and tritium into helium. Moreover, this little sphere stands
        far away from any solid matter, which otherwise would melt. The
        microwaves will produce heat, and also very strong magnetic and electric
        fields inside the compressed plasma. Magnetic fields correctly applied facilitate
        fusion because hydrogen unpaired electron and proton behave like small
        magnets. For example, such fields are present
        on the sun surface, especially around sunspots.&nbsp;</span><p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="FR-CA">This
        central sphere will simply become a little sun, constantly producing
        heat, hence electricity. </span><span lang="FR-CA"> It will work!&nbsp;</span><p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Both
        the acoustic and electronic (microwave) systems can coexist and achieve
        the very high pressure and heat requirements. <span lang="FR-CA">Russia experimented in 1961 a 57 megaton hydrogen bomb which detonator
        was a plutonium bomb. This is unthinkable for producing electricity. The
        goal is to safely obtain the fusion temperature and pressure point.
        Tritium for example is a dangerous substance which must be severely
        controlled. In addition, the fusion
        process produces neutrons which make matter in the vicinity become
        radioactive.</span><p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="FR-CA">The
        moon surface contains huge quantities of helium-3, whose fusion produces
        safer protons, but needs higher temperature. It also may directly
        transform energy into electricity because protons are positive.</span><p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="FR-CA">The
        most recent project in Cadarache, France, uses very strong magnetic
        fields in order to facilitate the fusion process and to isolate the plasma from any solid matter. But
        it still needs very high pressure and temperature, and so adding the standing wave method
        to the process appears quite relevant and reasonable.</span>
          <p align="left"><b>The magic formula.</b></p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The
        pressure diagram is the same as that of the electron. The whole reactor
        would look like artificial electron, and so Mr. Marcotte's
        formula is still relevant. The larger the sphere, the higher the pressure. Additionally,
        the shorter the wavelength, the higher the pressure too:</p>
          <p align="center">y = sin(x) / x</p>
          <p align="center">x = 2 * pi * distance / lambda</p>

        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The&nbsp;
        x&nbsp; variable is given by: 2 * pi * distance / lambda, and so the
        wavelength is important. On the other hand, a bigger core should produce
        more heat and energy. The core pressure is normalized to 1, but the goal
        is to obtain the required pressure for the fusion to become possible. The equation
        indicates which pressure should be applied on the inner side of the
        sphere.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"> Obviously,
        the amplitude is always positive for a compressed medium because vacuum is the lower
        limit. An asymmetry appears for very high
        amplitude levels. So, before proceeding, the hydrogen overall pressure should
        already be very high. The device
        also needs a chimney for collecting heat, and a system for recycling the
        hydrogen. The sphere can be replaced by an ellipsoid with two focus
        cores, producing a sort of &quot;artificial quark&quot; with high
        amplitude plane standing waves in-between. Then those standing waves may
        participate to the fusion process and greatly improve the device
        efficiency.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">I
        presume that engineers will find a practical way to produce Huygens
        wavelets on the inner surface of the sphere. Technically, most of the energy
        produced by at least one thousand loudspeakers regularly spaced should
        be transferred to the central core. I could check this with my own
        computerized medium without any surprise, because it is simply the
        Huygens Principle.</p>
        <p align="left"><b>A chain reaction.</b></p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">It
        should be emphasized that a chain reaction and self-amplification occurs. The
        resulting heat causes additional reactions to take place, allowing the
        standing wave system to oscillate permanently.</p>
