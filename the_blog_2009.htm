          Alpha conciliator (or observer) cannot see any difference between
          twins A and B. They just seem to move away from
          him at the same intermediate alpha speed, whose value is derived from
          Poincare's law of speed addition:</span></font></p>

          a result, from the Alpha point of view, their contraction is the same
          and their clocks are ticking at the same rate of time. Therefore, the
          three of them are more likely to adopt the same space and time units,
          even though they are definitely arbitrary, as a convention. There is
          no need to invoke an absurd and useless space-time transformation
          any more. Moreover, the transformation difference becomes much less
          severe. For example, the Lorentz contraction factor is only .9634
          instead of .866 using alpha = .268 instead of beta = .5.</span></font></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">It
          becomes obvious that, if they had previously departed simultaneously
          from the Alpha observer, those A and B twins should return home
          without any age difference between them, albeit they both should now
          be a bit younger than Alpha. This occurs because they must travel a
          longer absolute distance to perform the go and return trip, whatever
          the Alpha absolute speed is. A possible time effect may occur because of the deceleration and
          acceleration, but it is immaterial. It would be the same for A and B, it would be less
          severe because of the slower alpha speed and finally, its relative
          importance would become negligible if the round trip duration was very
          long. Thus, invoking a change in the inertial frame of reference is
          not relevant any more.</font></span></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
          train and tunnel paradox is subject to the same conclusions. If the
          Alpha observer considers that the train and the tunnel share the same
          length, it becomes pointless for A or B to argue that one of them only
          may be right. Actually, it will remain unknown forever. This is
          definitely a blind alley and hence, the Alpha compromise appears
          preferable.</span></font></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
          point is that the Alpha position is the best one. For example, protons
          are traveling in opposite directions at nearly the speed of light
          inside the Large Hadron Collider. The collider itself is obviously the best
          place in order to observe the collisions. Otherwise,
          as seen from a moving proton, the other protons which are
          theoretically moving in the opposite direction are &quot;only&quot;
          moving at nearly the speed of light, and so is the collider, whose
          speed appears to be just slightly slower. This doesn't make any sense
          because the actual proton relative speed should be nearly <b><i>twice</i></b> the speed of light.</span></font></p>

          finally realized that scientists should proceed to the analysis of two
          new sciences: Motion Mechanics and Motion Optics. It should be pointed
          out that Poincare and Einstein were both working on Relativity but
          that they were especially concerned about &quot;The Electrodynamics of
          Moving Bodies&quot;. As a matter of fact, the Lorentz transformations
          will lead us well beyond Relativity because they explain the causes,
          which are far more important than the effects.</span></font></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">In
          short, the Lorentz transformations are nothing else and nothing more
          than a Doppler effect. Relativity holds true and hence, one should be
          aware that matter transforms because it is made of waves. This
          explains Matter Mechanics and especially Newton's laws, for example <a href="sa_active.htm">action
          and reaction</a> effects where the Doppler effect is obviously involved.
          This is why this science should be called Motion Mechanics. In
          addition, studying waves in the presence of motion leads to an
          important section of Motion Mechanics which should be called Motion
          Optics.</span></font></p>

          They were actually created in 1887 by Woldemar Voigt in order to
          produce an artificial space-time transformation, and Lorentz was well
          aware that they were inverted. He explained that it was only a
          &quot;mathematical artifice&quot;. After many years of analysis and
          intense reflection, I finally proposed the reversed version below,

          must be considered. It should be remembered that they had been borrowed
          from Woldemar Voigt's equations (1887), which were intended to <b><i>neutralize</i></b>
          the Doppler effect in a moving frame of reference. Not to produce it. Because of
          this, Lorentz and his friend Poincare used the equation set the same
          way. It is a well known fact that they considered a moving electron,
          so that the x' and t' variables were applied to the stationary
          electron. Very few people pointed out that x' and t' should rather
          stand for the moving electron variables. Quite reasonably, the x and t
          variables should apply to the stationary electron. That is why I had
          to reverse Lorentz's equations this way:</font></p>

          equations. Although these additional equations were absent from Lorentz's 1904
          work, he admitted that they did make sense. Lorentz's goal was to show that
          the Michelson interferometer was undergoing a contraction and that Maxwell's equations were becoming
          invariant under his transformations. Poincare added the symmetric
          equation set in order to introduce - also in

          consequences are&nbsp; enormous. Instead of transforming space and
          time (Lorentz wrote that it was only a mathematical artifice), they
          rather indicate a contraction (according to g x) and a translation
          motion (according to b t, which is merely the Galilean transformation,
          or Galileo's Relativity Principle) of a material system, empty
          in-between distances included. They also
          indicate that moving clocks display slower seconds (according to g t) together with a time

          strongly recommend that you verify that I am really making use of this
          new equation set in the program in order to <b><i>produce</i></b> (non
          correct) the Doppler effect on the right side of the image. This is a
          flawless demonstration that Voigt's goal was to deal with the Doppler
          effect, not with space and time. But surprisingly, I also use them to contract B and C, which are observers traveling
          along with hypothetic material bodies. Their speed is 50% of the speed of light,
          hence beta = .5 c, but B is moving backward. I use them to slow
          down the emitters frequency along with the seconds displayed by B and
          C clocks. And finally, I use them to obtain the time shift with
          respect to B' or C', whose distance to their twin B or C is 10
          light-seconds. It is quite easy to understand that, because the
          relative speed of a radio signal is faster backward (according to 1 +
          b = 1.5 c) then forward (according to 1 <span lang="FR-CA" style="font-family: Times New Roman; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: FR-CA; mso-fareast-language: FR; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">–</span>

          Here, it is accelerated to 50% of the speed of light to the right.
          However, C and C' are already moving to the right at this speed, so
          that their new speed should be the speed of light. But Lorentz and
          Poincare discovered that no material body is capable of reaching the
          speed of light. This is why </font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">their resulting speed is only .8 c,

          my opinion, such a magnificent harmony should leave nobody unfeeling.
          Now, thanks to Lorentz, Relativity can be explained. There are no
          paradoxes any more. All is clear and logic.</font></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">On
          the one hand, it now becomes possible to display more than two
          material bodies (hundreds, actually) whose speed and direction differ.
          The results remain perfectly coherent after the scanning process, or
          the acceleration if you prefer.</font></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">On
          the other hand, a preferred stationary frame of reference may be
          designated as a convention. It should allow all observers to have a
          better image of their situation. Ideally, it is the one whose speed is
          intermediate, for instance the red scale as seen from A and B.
          Surprisingly, this red scale does not transform because its
          intermediate speed (not exactly .25 c because of Poincare's law of
          speed addition) is simply inverted after undergoing the acceleration.
          Its speed being the same, its contraction remains the same, so that A and B can adjust its length when they
          meet (they must consider that they are moving in opposite directions
          at the same speed). They can also adjust its clock rate so that it stubbornly displays the &quot;absolute&quot;
          time on condition that is is placed where x = 0 when A and B meet and
          on condition that they synchronize all clocks according to t = 0 when
          they meet, too. The time shift is
          inverted everywhere else because the red scale is stopped, then
          accelerated at the same speed in the opposite direction.</font></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">All
          becomes perfectly clear. The red scale length does not change and the
          clock displays the absolute time on condition that A and B,&nbsp; A
          and C, or B and C (two of them only) designate an intermediate one as
          a preferred Cartesian frame of reference. Thus, there exists a
          situation in which space and time remains constant. To put it even
          clearer, as Euclid, Galileo, Descartes and Newton always thought,
          space and time <b><i>do not transform</i></b>.</font></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">For
          instance, an intermediate Cartesian frame of reference may be that of
          the physicist who is observing two electrons colliding when they are
          moving in opposite directions at nearly the speed of light. In this
          case, the electrons relative speed is nearly <b><i>two times</i></b>
          that of the light. According to Lorentz, another observer moving along
          with one of those electrons would rather see the other electron
          approaching only at nearly the speed of light. This point of view
          appears frankly distorted, so that the frame of reference of the
          collider is much more acceptable.</font></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Similarly, let's suppose that a GPS
          system uses two satellites orbiting in opposite directions (avoiding
          collisions, though!). Then the observer on earth appears to be the
          only one capable of correctly analyzing the situation. He observes that the
          satellites slightly contract and that initially, they indicate a
          slightly slower time and exhibit a time shift. So he must imperatively
          impose his own time units to the satellites. There is no Relativity to
          consider here. What's more, because the GPS system uses many
          satellites orbiting in the same direction, they cannot be synchronized
          using radio signals from one to another because of the Sagnac effect
          (the time shift, actually), although it remains possible to correct
          the anomaly. It appears preferable to correct the error using radio
          signals emitted from earth.</font></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">I
          also suggest that the center of inertia of the whole solar
          system should determine the preferred frame of reference in order to
          verify Mercury's orbit. Only this point may be reasonably postulated
          to be stationary, so that the speed of Mercury and its orbit does not
          appear the same as seen from it. In addition, the sun itself rotates around this center of
          inertia, so that Mercury's orbit is severely modified especially when
          Jupiter is coming in conjunction with Saturn. Although this is not
          really a Relativity problem because there is no relativistic speed
          involved here, the choice of a preferred frame of reference still
          leads to a better picture of the situation.</font></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In
          practice, Einstein's theory of Relativity appears inapplicable.
          Establishing a preferred frame of reference is advantageous. The
          present demonstration indicates that many of them are possible but
          that some of them are much better. Only Lorentz's version of Relativity
          allows such a choice. It should be pointed out that all this cannot be
          explained without the presence of the aether. Even if it cannot be
          detected, all happens as if it exists because the speed of light must
          imperatively be related to it.</font></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The
          Lorentz transformations indicate that all this happens <b><i>solely</i></b>
          because of the Doppler effect. This strongly suggests that matter is
          undergoing the Doppler effect. Matter behaves like waves do. Lorentz's
          Relativity indicates that matter consists of waves
          propagating at the speed of light. Such waves need a medium, the
          aether, so that finally, there is nothing else but the aether...</font></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">It
          turns out that the Lorentz
          transformations are leading us well beyond Relativity. Now, we are dealing
          with matter mechanics, more exactly the Wave Mechanics.</font></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The conclusion is that Newton's laws and
          that all physical phenomena must be reviewed in order to match the

          wrote a program showing that Maxwell's equations cannot become invariant under
          the Lorentz transformations the way they were released in 1904.
          Lorentz's theory remains correct, however, on condition that his
          equations indicate matter transformation, not space and
          time. This is easily feasible by swapping x and x' variables,
          and also t and t'.</font></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">This
          may appear hard to believe. Yet one must admit that correctly applying
          the Lorentz transformations to Maxwell's equations is a rather
          complicated procedure. Those equations were quite new at that time and
          I suppose that very few experts in radio electricity did examine
          Lorentz's hypothesis. Most of them may not have well understood
          Lorentz's or Poincare's procedure either. It appears quite possible that the
          remaining very few people who detected the anomaly did not dare to
          challenge Lorentz and Poincare because they were two well known
          scientists.</font></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Surely,
          x' = g x leads to x = x' / g. Such a perfectly reversible equation set
          is quite easy to obtain, a lot of them can make Maxwell's equations
          becoming invariant, but here the goal is to match the very special
          Doppler effect which was proposed by Lorentz. A slower
          &quot;time&quot; leads to a slower frequency and the resulting overall
          longer wavelength finally cancels the normal Doppler transverse
          contraction, which is the very first condition for Relativity to be
          true. From this point of view, Lorentz's original equation set leads to a
          serious anomaly...&nbsp;</font></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Additionally,
          Maxwell's equations are definitely not important here. The goal is to
          obtain the equation set which produces Lorentz's special Doppler
          effect involving a slower frequency. Then it becomes easier (and still
          unnecessary) to check the resulting invariance using Maxwell's
          equations. The
          important point is that no wavelength contraction occurs any
          more on transverse axes: y' = y; z' = z. On a standing wave basis,
          this also leads to a stunning axial wavelength contraction (and ultimately to
          matter contraction) according to Lorentz's contraction factor: g

          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Then

          on condition that x and x' are exchanged. Surprisingly, swapping x and
          x' fully restores the correct situation. Instead of dealing with an absurd
          space transformation, it appears simpler to do what Lorentz's had in

          compiled program shows how a moving source may undergo four different Doppler
          effects according to
          four different frequency shifts. I used Woldemar Voigt's equations in order
          to show that Lorentz version (where k = 1 becomes useless) is
          preferable. Lorentz used it in order to explain the Michelson
          interferometer contraction. Actually, as explained above, I had to use
          the reversed version because Voigt's original goal was to correct (not
          to produce) the

          Doppler effect occurs in all cases. But surprisingly, Voigt's constant
          may be adjusted to obtain a frequency shift. The second choice
          (B) reproduces the normal Doppler effect, which does not involve any
          frequency shift. Michelson was not aware that a frequency shift may
          occur, but he was perfectly aware that the wave relative speed should
          be faster transversally according to Lorentz's shrinking factor g (this
          means that this &quot;aberration&quot; was Michelson's discovery, not Voigt's).
          The Michelson interferometer was developed on this basis. The third
          choice (C) rather shows Lorentz's version, where the constant k = 1
          becomes useless. In this case, the emitter frequency slows down
          according to g.</font></p>

          characteristic is a slower frequency. In this case, there is no
          transverse wavelength contraction any more, hence no transverse matter
          contraction either because matter exhibits wave properties. This is the very first condition for
          Maxwell's equations to becoming invariant so that Relativity becomes
          explainable.</font></p>

          unfortunately, instead of admitting that matter just transforms the
          same way standing waves do (this was discovered later by Yuri Yvanov),
          Poincare and Einstein strongly deviated from Lorentz's initial
          hypothesis. Their incredible ignorance of standing waves appears to be
          the chief explanation of their failure. They thought that optical
          phenomena were purely relative. Then the speed difference only is to be
          considered and consequently there is no preferred frame of reference
          any more. Especially, the aether must be ruled out as a material
          support for &quot;electromagnetic waves&quot; because it would
          obviously be a preferred frame of reference. One must rely on
          non-Euclidean geometry in order to manage those totally absurd ideas,
          and this finally ended with Minkowski's &quot;space-time&quot; even
          more absurd concept. This unbelievable story needs some more

          Lorentz's initial idea was that the Michelson Interferometer had to
          undergo an axial contraction but no transverse transformation in order
          to explain Michelson's well known null result. This is possible only on
          condition that the wave period slows down and for this reason, one
          observes that clocks tick slower and do not indicate the same time
          along the displacement axis. I admit that all this is a bit puzzling,
          but I still must say here that I am rather surprised that nobody seems
          to have thoroughly examined this hypothesis. Even Lorentz himself did
          not. Amazingly, nobody elaborated a comprehensive Theory or
          Relativity on this basis, despite the fact that it was <b><i>highly
          consistent</i></b>.</font></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">2.
          I can easily read Poincare's books because I am French. It clearly
          appears that he just ruled out Lorentz's contraction without any
          further analysis (Electricity and Optics, 1901). He even stated that
          Lorentz's hypothesis did not yield satisfying results without any
          acceptable argument. Such properties for matter indeed appeared
          &quot;strange&quot; in 1901 (but much less today because we know that
          matter and especially electrons obviously exhibit wave properties),
          but they did explain Michelson's null result and many other
          unexplained phenomena such as Bradley's aberration of light. Thus, it
          had (and it is still) to be carefully examined.</font></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">3.
          The puzzling &quot;local time&quot; was discovered independently by Lorentz
          and Poincare. It should be pointed out that this phenomenon becomes
          undetectable only on condition that the contraction really occurs. It
          is quite worrying to remember that here, Poincare had a major advantage on
          Lorentz. He had been appointed to the &quot;Bureau des
          Longitudes&quot; in 1893 and he had to examine such &quot;local
          hours&quot;, a mere consequence of the Earth's motion through the
          well-accepted aether. However, I could find no evidence that he did
          examine this phenomenon in the case of an hypothetic contraction.
          Apparently, he did not notice that in this case, the local time would
          become unnoticeable and surely, he did not admit that this was a major
          argument in favor of Lorentz's hypothesis.</font></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">4.
          A wave period may be useful for making amazingly precise clocks, but
          it is still not the &quot;time&quot;. When Lorentz released his famous
          equation set using Voigt's t and t' variables, he did not realize that
          they were quite misleading. Displaying spherical waves on a large area
          must be performed in two different steps. Firstly, the distance to the
          emitter and its frequency must be taken into account. The precise wave
          period for a given coordinate is to be calculated according to the
          delay for each wave front to reach this coordinate. This delay must be
          given in absolute time units (do not try to introduce a time
          transformation here, it doesn't work!) and this is indeed all about
          time. However, the above computer program indicates that the Voigt-Lorentz
          equations do not account for this first procedure. They just rule the
          second step establishing the new emitter coordinates (because of the
          contraction) and its new phase (because of the slower frequency and
          also Michelson's apparently
          unequal wave speed). The point is: this
          phase is repetitive and it must be given in 2 pi units. To say it
          shortly, one must realize this it is not exactly what the concept of
          time is. The time has no true existence. It only refers to an
          arbitrary convention. In spite of this, Poincare introduced a
          &quot;time dilation&quot; concept and frankly, this is a shame.</font></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">5.
          In spite of his exceptional knowledge in physics, Poincare was
          definitely a mathematician and a philosopher well before being a
          physicist. That is why he was not especially interested in how the
          light mechanically propagates (it is still a mystery nowadays). He
          instantly agreed with Maxwell about those fast moving electric and
          magnetic fields which did not need an aether any more. His point was:
          &quot;The equations work, why bothering about the mechanics?&quot; And
          so, as soon as he could establish his own symmetric equation set,
          where there is no variable for the speed of light any more, Poincare
          immediately thought that the aether hypothesis could be abandoned.
          Once again, this is a shame. No true physicist would dare to rule out
          any plausible hypothesis unless he is fully aware of the nature
          of a physical phenomenon.</font></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">6.
          Poincare had abandoned the idea of absolute space and time units well
          before 1905. This quote is from his 1905 book (Science and
          Hypothesis): &quot;<i>All those things do not exist prior to the
          mechanics than the French language exists prior to all truths which
          are expressed in French</i>&quot;. This is ridiculous. Relativity
          holds true because the moving observer is fooled by an unexpected and
          amazing Doppler effect. There is no other way to remain logical. For
          instance, he is unable to detect the aether wind by means of an
          interferometer because of matter contraction. Let's make things
          perfectly clear: facts are absolute, they simply cannot be relative.
          From this point of view, space and time units (as a convention) are
          also absolute. Thus, the time as proposed by the Greenwich observatory
          is arbitrary and somewhat unstable, but it is still absolute. Whatever
          his speed and position, any observer is capable of dealing with that
          on condition that he is well aware of the Lorentz transformations.</font></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">7.
          Euclid realized that evidences cannot be explained and he proposed
          some of them as &quot;postulates&quot;. Evidences just need to become
          spontaneously present in one's mind but apparently, very few people
          are capable of this most unexplainable process: understanding.
          Admitting the quite obvious fact that the Earth is overpopulated is a
          good example... Although they remain disputable, </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Euclid
          needed postulates for elaborating his famous geometry, which still
          yields correct results today. However, in the last period up to his
          death, Poincare was interested in non-Euclidean geometry, which is a
          pure absurdity. This was his worst error. He was also interested in
          gravity, and as usual Einstein &quot;borrowed&quot; his ideas (the
          Mercury precession problem especially was firstly analyzed by
          Poincare). He developed a &quot;General Relativity&quot; theory based
          on space curvature. Let's put it this way: <b><i>all this is totally
          absurd</i></b>.</font></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">It
          becomes clear that the main person responsible for leading us in a
          blind alley was Henri Poincare, who was shamelessly copied by Albert
          Einstein afterwards. We are now facing a lot of errors which prove to
          be an obstacle to further discoveries. Scientists working on GPS
          systems had to make their way out of Einstein's illogic postulates.
          Today, they are realizing that clocks and frequencies, and
          even the speed of light on Earth are a good absolute reference after
          all. The satellite clocks and the radio oscillators are known to tick a bit slower and they need
          to be adjusted in order to match those on Earth. If they are not, the
          radio waves emitted by the satellite are undergoing Lorentz's slower Doppler effect.
          This is measurable and verifiable on Earth, yet an astronaut in this
          satellite is totally unable to detect it. He is rather detecting a
          Doppler effect in the waves emitted from the Earth surface. And finally, the satellite
          contraction ratio is so tiny that it is still not
          detectable using our most accurate devices. But it does contract, and
          this behavior is detectable using much longer distances.</font></p>

          90° angle produces a new wave front whose phase is lambda/4 shifted.
          This phenomenon is a confirmation that the light waves cannot be
          stopped by matter. Surprisingly, the shade behind matter is caused by
          wavelets whose phase is opposite. This is not really a surprise
          because radio waves, X-rays and gamma rays are <b><i>not</i></b>
          stopped by matter. Let's face it, most of the spectrum obeys this rule
          and the light is the exception. In addition, a metallic screen or wire
          (especially a parasite antenna) are well known to capture some of the
          energy and then emit such wavelets whose phase is opposite. According
          to their number and their distribution, they also produce a shade
          exhibiting a characteristic diffraction pattern. However, in this
          case, the beam splitter very thin reflecting layer is insufficient to
          cancel the whole energy passing through it.</font></span></p>

          comparison, Special Relativity now appears frankly unreasonable. Those

          Relativity. They were comfortably installed in their unexplainable
          certitude but those new facts (and more to come) are definitely
          waiting for new explanations.</font></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Up
          to now, nobody seems to have clearly described this remarkable
          behavior. The good idea should be to <b><i>reasonably explain</i></b>
          the resulting appearance of Relativity without Einstein's absurdities.
          As a matter of fact, Lorentzian Relativity is still to elaborate.
          Lorentz was definitely on the right track but he never went beyond a
          mere explanation of Bradley's and Michelson's unexpected results and,
          perhaps, a better description of the transformed particles. What's
          worse, Henri Poincaré and Einstein ruled out matter contraction and
          (almost) the aether itself. Fortunately, they were all quite sure that
          faster then light speeds were impossible.&nbsp;This is not what some
          supporters of Lorentz's Relativity wrongfully think.</font></p>

          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">I
          also experimented successfully the Bradley aberration of light in a
          moving frame of reference. Then the emitted light waves are undergoing
          the Doppler effect. Once again, the results are perfectly compatible
          with the existence of the aether. The hard to detect aether wind was
          the main problem well before Michelson. Sir Airy, the famous
          astronomer, was strangely clinging to Fresnel's idea that the wind
          speed should be proportional to the refraction index for glass or
          water. His experience using a telescope filled up with water was still
          a failure. All those phenomena including Michelson's experiment and
          Bradley's aberration of light seemed totally unexplainable.</font></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Considering
          the complexity of those phenomena and the lack of tools to check them,
          the 1900's mess is quite understandable. But I finally obtained
          flawless proofs that a moving observer always sees his environment as
          though he were perfectly stationary. Thanks to the virtual medium and
          my <a href="sa_scanner.htm">Time Scanner</a>, I can easily demonstrate
          that <b><i>apparently</i></b>, all optical phenomena don't change in

          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">And
          once again, it is on condition that the emitter frequency really slows
          down and that Lorentz's contraction (especially that of an optical
          device such as a parabola) takes place only along the direction of
          motion. Those clips are especially revealing. They clearly show how
          curved waves undergoing the Doppler effect are reflected on a
          parabola. They are transformed into plane waves, but they become
          tilted to the theta angle = arc sin (v/c). Then they are reflected on
          a plane mirror in such a way that the interference pattern follows the
          phase wave, whose speed is 1/beta. All along this phase wave,
          Lorentz's&nbsp; t'&nbsp; &quot;local time&quot; does not change.
          Finally, the waves return to the parabola, which focuses them into a
          classical Airy Disk, albeit it is contracted and submitted to the same
          local time according to the phase wave. It turns out that Lorentz was
          right. It is a fact. It is undisputable...</font></p>

          also suffer from spherical aberration if the object distance is
          finite. In spite of this, parallax detection is still possible. And

          the Lorentz Transformations cannot be neglected any more.&nbsp;The
          Doppler effect is present, it is easily measurable, and according to
          those new results the parabola must contract in order to reflect
          microwaves correctly.&nbsp; Here, speaking about space and time
          transformation is totally useless. It is rather a matter of true

          on Earth are to be preferred; in this particular case we do not have

          it was the case. The observer orbiting in a satellite is fully aware
          of his abnormal situation. Because he knows that his speed simply
          cannot be zero, he must admit that his emitter is sending waves which
          are undergoing the Doppler effect. He also knows that this effect is
          easily detectable on Earth, which is postulated to be stationary. And

          to detect his motion. Firstly, the phase wave cancels the Doppler

          Surprisingly, both focal planes appear simultaneous and perfectly
          symmetrical during a given t' time. This happens because waves
          traveling backward are faster, so that the information only appears

          the Earth being the preferred frame of reference, the speed difference
          only, not the absolute speed, should be considered. It becomes clear
          that optical phenomena and even mechanical phenomena still appear
          identical in the satellite environment. Even length contraction is
          unnoticeable because the observer is also contracted.</font> <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">This

          <p align="left"><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Now, let's
          examine the Bradley aberration of light.</font></b></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Bradley's
          goal was to measure the distance to the nearest stars by detecting a
          parallax effect. The Earth's orbit proved to be a bit too small to do
          this, but Bradley unexpectedly discovered a different phenomenon.
          Because the speed of the Earth around the Sun is about 29 km/s, the
          telescope motion produces a small but measurable focus offset. Bradley
          soon realized that this effect was a consequence of the speed of
          light.</font></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Our
          virtual medium can easily show this. It is quite impossible to set the
          emitter (which represents a star) several light years away, but a
          large parabola produces the equivalent plane waves. Then let's add two
          small parabolas (Bradley's telescope) moving in opposite directions
          the way they would do around the Sun at 6-month intervals. In this
          first experience, the Sun is postulated to be perfectly stationary and
          the telescope speed is exaggerated to 1/3 of the speed of light in
          order to obtain a more dramatic effect.</font></p>

          surprise here: the Airy disk pattern reaches the point where the
          parabola optical axis was previously. </span>This result is quite
          simple and understandable. It was a good idea to firstly show what is
          normally going on, though, because the two parabolas and the wave
          patterns no longer remain symmetric if the Sun is moving. Today, we
          know very well that the Sun is orbiting around the galaxy center even
          faster then the Earth does around the Sun.</font></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The
          point is: Bradley did obtain a perfect symmetry. Such a result seemed
          to indicate that the sun is perfectly stationary with respect to the
          aether. Surely, the sun motion should rather introduce a severe
          asymmetry. Here, let's suppose that the Sun is moving at about one
          half of the speed of light. When both the Sun and the Earth are moving
          in the same direction, the speed of the Earth is accelerated to .5 +
          .33 = .83 c. Otherwise, it is rather slowed down to .5 - .33 = .23 c.
          So the Earth and the parabolas must periodically contract in
          accordance with Lorentz's shrinking factor. However, in order to
          reproduce the same 1/3 c velocity as above, as seen by the moving
          observer, one must refer to Poincare's law of speed addition, which is
          given by:</font></p>
          <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">beta''
          = (beta + beta') / (1 + beta * beta')</span></font></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">It
          turns out that the slowest and fastest composite speed should be .2
          and .7143 c. Then the contraction difference is severe: 98% vs. 70%.
          Obtaining a symmetric result using those differently contracted
          parabolas now appears unlikely to be possible, especially in the
          presence of the additional Doppler effect. Poincare's 1901 theory
          (&quot;optical phenomena are relative&quot;) was attractive because it
          was much simpler and apparently correct. I am quite sure that Lorentz
          did figure out such a scenario because Bradley and Michelson had
          severely damaged Newton's system. He had to abandon his hypothesis,
          for he was a great scientist. <b><i>It simply could not work.</i></b></font></p>

          leads to Lorentz's Relativity. Consequently, Special Relativity is
          deadly wounded. Einstein's version (actually that of Poincare) was indeed attractive
          because it yielded correct predictions.
          No doubt, it was valuable, but now we need to know why all this is
          possible. We need to know how matter works. The basic principle is that any moving system still
          mechanically works
          perfectly on condition that those strange effects take place. Because of them,
          the moving observer cannot be aware of his motion any more. He still

          it was important to elaborate the correct equation set&nbsp; for this,

          equations in a moving frame of reference. <b><i> Surprisingly, Lorentz's x'

          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Let's
          make things perfectly clear: Lorentzian Relativity simply cannot be
          explained without those equations. They <b><i> must</i></b> be adopted by any
          scientist who is interested in Lorentz's works, even though Lorentz
          neglected to put them down this way.&nbsp;Secondly, I demonstrated a
          long time ago that those equations also produce <a href="sa_Doppler.htm">Lorentz's
          slower Doppler effect</a>. In this case, x variables stand for axial
          distances in wavelengths and t variables stand for the wave period, hence
          in 2*pi units. And thirdly, this is highly consistent with my <a href="sa_scanner.htm">Time
          Scanner</a>. Three independent and spectacular confirmations of the same facts cannot
          be a coincidence. The Lorentz Transformations are definitely a law of
          nature, and they are all about matter mechanics. Clearly, they will
          lead us well
          beyond Relativity.</font></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Fortunately,
          in this form, Lorentz's equations </font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">become
          quite easy to understand. One must bear in mind that all x and x'
          variables stand for absolute distances in light seconds, so that c =
          1. On the contrary, while only t variables stand for absolute seconds,
          Lorentz carefully explained that t' variables do not indicate the
          &quot;true time&quot;. They only indicate slower seconds that clocks in this moving
          frame of reference should display. Suppose
          that velocity is 50% of the speed of light, hence beta = 0.5 and
          Lorentz's contraction factor is: g = 0.866. And finally, x = 1 and a
          one second delay (t = 1) occurred.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">1. g * x&nbsp;
          means that matter and distances contract to 86.6% of their original
          length along the direction of motion in accordance with Lorentz's
          contraction factor.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">2. beta *
          t&nbsp; means that matter simply moves to x' = 0.5 * 1 = 0.5 light
          second after a one second delay according to its speed. This is Galileo's Relativity Principle.
          However, because the coordinate was shifted to x'=0.866 after the
          contraction occurred, the final x' position is 0.866+0.5= 1.366 light
          second.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">3. g * t means
          that moving clocks tick 86.6% slower, once again according to
          Lorentz's contraction factor. More exactly, the electron frequency and
          that of any cyclic mechanical process slows down. This is why the
          transverse wavelength, hence transverse distances, remains constant
          according to Lorentz's y'=y; z'=z.&nbsp;</font></p>

          consequence, and additionally because the contraction is unnoticeable
          as well, the clock synchronization procedure using light or radio
          signals perfectly matches this anomaly. It should be emphasized that
          this is not only a mere time shift. Cause and effect
          relationships are undergoing the same Doppler distortion, simply
          because causes are transmitted by waves. Thus, speaking about space
          and time transformation is meaningless and useless. One should rather
          consider that this appearance of simultaneity leads to an amazing but
          understandable mystification: the moving observer cannot detect his true speed through the aether
          any more.</font></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">This
          time shift can also be cross-checked by means of the phase wave, where
          Lorentz's
          t' time remains the same. It is where
          transverse waves incoming from opposite directions encounter, given
          the fact that they are tilted to an angle which is given by: arc sin
          (v/c). The result is a scissor effect. Because of this constant but &quot;moving&quot; t' time, two observers A and B placed on
          the displacement axis will think that the wave front crosses this axis at the
          same time. So it will seem parallel to it, not tilted. I invented my <a href="sa_scanner.htm">Time

          optical or radio apparatus. Here, the phase wave is visible two times,
          firstly for plane but tilted waves, then for moving circular standing waves

                  Lorentz Transformations apply to matter the same way the Doppler effect applies to waves responsible for matter
                  mechanics. That is why the observer &quot;cannot have any means of

                  point is: most certainly, the observer <b><i>is</i></b>

                  presence of the aether. On the contrary, nobody ever explained how
                  such a wonder could be possible without the aether. Let's face it:
                  the idea that one's motion with respect to
                  another material body is purely relative was attractive,
                  partly because its basic principles were simple, and
                  obviously because its predictions were correct. Unfortunately,
                  it must be rejected because it is unreasonable and misleading.
                  It is a severe
                  obstacle to understanding things. In physics, even a correct
                  prediction is unsatisfactory. The ultimate goal is to <b><i>explain</i></b>

        become unavoidable for studying matter waves. It is a well known fact
        that matter exhibits wave properties. In spite of that, up to now, very
        few people realized that matter waves cannot be just an analogy. Waves
        are waves. Here, one is dealing with standing waves, wave fronts,
        amplitude, frequency, wavelength, interference patterns, etc. The goal
        is to show that regular waves can influence spherical standing waves.
        Thus, considering that the electron is a pulsating wave center, two of
        them put together are surely capable of influencing one another. This is
        all about Newton's action and reaction law.</font></p>

        You may change its position, amplitude, wavelength, etc. You may also
        add a second one to observe interferences. There is also a linear
        emitter (observe the Fresnel-Fraunhofer diffraction), a circular emitter

        more interesting than flavorless equations. I made a lot of similar

        unpredictable. Their &quot;personality&quot; is mainly dependent on the
        medium properties. That is why we
        need to explore many wave algorithms. However, I already made my choice:
        in order to achieve the electron amplification, the aether should be
        made of granules repelling themselves. In my picture, it must be
        compressible. </font></td>
