        after the Greek mythology and according to Hesiod, </span>
        was the son of Erebos (dark place in Underworld) and of Nyx (the Night). He was the personification of the clear
        upper air breathed by the Olympus Gods and Goddesses. Descartes realized
        that waves need a medium. He was convinced that light was made of
        waves and he wisely named the required medium <b><i>éther</i></b> after
        the Greek God. I am of an opinion that the English word should be
        spelled aether, not ether, in order to be respectful to Descartes'
        language. Please note that the acute accent replaces a second vowel.
        What is more, the Greek word <b><i>aither</i></b> also strongly suggests it.</font><p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">This
        site does not explain how the aether works mechanically. Any medium capable of
        transmitting regular longitudinal waves could do the job. In order to keep things simple, one should postulate that
        the aether is perfectly homogeneous
        and that it preserves energy without any loss.
        Then it would transmit sinusoidal waves whose speed c is constant. It is the
        well known speed of light,
        but please remember that it is also that of matter waves and all
        invisible forces
        transmitted by aether waves.</font><p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">So
        the aether is also the medium for electrons as spherical standing wave
        systems. Because such systems constantly radiate spherical waves, they need replenishment. This is why
        the aether should also have been filled with
        energetic waves
        since its very beginning.

        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The
        true mechanism for all physical phenomena is still totally unknown.
        Until it is well established, the wave hypothesis remains the most
        acceptable one.&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The true nature of particles such as electrons, protons
        or neutrons is still a mystery. The very existence of hypothetic
        particles such as photons or neutrinos was never demonstrated. They were
        just highly attractive hypotheses. Thus they tend to evolve into
        certitude without any additional reasonable argument. Up to now, Descartes' explanation about
        the light remains the only acceptable one: it is made of waves and it
        behaves like waves propagating by means of a medium. Except for very
        rare misleading, misunderstood and oversimplified phenomena, the light <b><i>does not</i></b>
        behave like particles as far as its quantum properties are attributed to
        electrons.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Nobody
        ever reasonably explained how gravity works, either. So, until somebody furnishes an acceptable
        explanation, we must admit that we are dealing with the unknown. Forces such as gravity or light could
        very well work using just waves. Surely, gravity cannot &quot;bend space&quot;.
        From a mechanical point of view, this is totally absurd.</p>

        discovered that light is made of waves and that it should be carried by
        a medium. His pupil Christiaan
        Huygens described aether as &quot;subtle air spheres in contact&quot; in
        order to explain the way such waves are transmitted. Note that he
        immediately tried to find the mechanism! Unfortunately, such an attitude
        becomes more and more the exception nowadays.</span><p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="FR-CA">Descartes was
        right: the light is made of waves and it needs a medium. And Huygens was
        right: the aether needs a mechanism. </span><span lang="FR-CA">This web site shows that

        <p align="left"><b>Augustin Fresnel.</b></p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="FR-CA">
        Augustin Fresnel thought that the light waves should vibrate transversally
        according to his observations on light polarization through Iceland Spath.
        Then he
        supposed that aether should be made of material points separated by
        intervals.&nbsp;</span><p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="FR-CA">However,
        such transverse vibrations do not really occur. Light is made of regular
        longitudinal waves and the phases only vibrate transversally. Light
        waves are composite in nature so they can carry transverse phase
        patterns. The material points idea definitely remains the best one,
        though. Such a structure is the simplest possible and it nevertheless
        explains two important phenomena.</span><p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="FR-CA">Firstly,
        our analysis of wave behavior through such points (we prefer
        &quot;granules&quot; because a point cannot exist) indicates that some
        anomalies should occur. For example, the wave speed slows down if the
        wavelength is very short. Just a few granules for a whole wavelength
        introduces a &quot;quantum&quot; effect.</span><p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="FR-CA">Secondly,
        material points becoming more and more distant can explain the Universe
        expansion. In such a case, very fast and distant galaxies would still be
        at rest with respect to the aether points over there.&nbsp;</span><p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="FR-CA">&nbsp;The
        program below shows that Mr. Anselme Dewavrin's algorithm, which is
        derived from Euler's method, does not yield exactly the same results as
        the accurate y = sin(2 * pi * x / lambda) procedure, especially when the
        discrete steps are insufficient as compared to the wavelength. It turns
        out that the so-called error in Euler's method is actually a true fact.
        The aether does produce this error, it is really made out of points or
        granules which transmit energy by discrete steps.</span><p align="center"><a href="programs/Aether01_Dewavrin.bas">Aether01_Dewavrin.bas</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <a href="programs/Aether01_Dewavrin.exe">Aether01_Dewavrin.exe</a></p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="FR-CA">Another example is the always
        positive medium, which cannot produce perfectly symmetrical sine waves
        for very high amplitude levels. The high amplitude (high compression)
        level is unlimited while the lower amplitude reaches a limit, which is
        the absence of granules inside a given space. I am quite sure that this
        anomaly explains very well the electron amplification because standing
        waves produce such an asymmetry.</span><p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="FR-CA">So
        granules whose unique property is to repel one another is the perfect
        medium for aether waves. A similar model with both attractive and
        repulsive properties allowed Mr. Delmotte (see the Virtual Aether below)
        to elaborate a fantastic computerized medium. Six months later, Mr.
        Marcotte invented a different algorithm which is a bit simpler, and then
        a more complex but faster one.</span></center></font></td>

        Because waves are becoming important, such programs will be progressively upgraded
        and they will be a must for all students in the world. I could already
        check a lot of wave phenomena, especially in a moving frame of reference; this greatly helps for studying Relativity.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">For
        instance, Lorentz explained ten years before Einstein that the Michelson
        interferometer could not reveal the aether wind because it contracts.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The
        point is that the 45° transparent mirror (the beam splitter) should
        also undergo a contraction, making the reflecting surface angle
        different. According to standard rules in optics, the beam would not be
        reflected to a 90° angle any more. Many scientists argued that the
        interferometer contraction was impossible. Poincaré especially spoke
        about an &quot;ad hoc&quot; explanation without any valid reason and
        finally, Lorentz's hypothesis was ruled out. It was a huge mistake.
        Matter contraction really occurs in such a way that any observer
        moving along with a wave system can no longer detect its motion. All
        seems to happen as if he was at rest. This is Relativity.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><b>Stunning Videos.</b></p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">In
        October 2007, I made several DivX MPEG-4 videos. They show clearly that
        the mirror must be tilted to an additional angle in order to reflect the
        light beam to the correct 90° angle. I made one for all axes and
        directions, and also with the incorrect 45° angle. It turns out that
        the new angle is consistent with Lorenz's contraction factor. So the
        interferometer must contract: there is no other logical explanation.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"> <b><i>Lorentz
        was right.</i></b> It is that simple. Matter contraction was not obvious
        in 1895 but it is now easily
        foreseeable on condition that matter is made of waves. Clearly, all
        wave phenomena are submitted to the Doppler effect.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">As
        far as I know, the light beam behavior inside the moving apparatus has
        never been displayed. In my opinion, this experience is even
        more important than Michelson's. Thanks to Mr. Philippe Delmotte's
        Virtual Aether, it is now possible. Many scientists don't even know that
        the light beam waves must be tilted to the theta angle = arc sin (v / c)
        in order to propagate transversally. Moreover, the light beam itself and
        Fresnel's diffraction pattern also undergo the on-axis contraction.</p>

        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Energy
        and inertia are replaced by sine and cosine. This amazingly simple
        calculus placed in a <b><i>computer loop</i></b> indeed allows one to
        obtain a sinusoidal curve, the same one which could be obtained using
        Euler's method. Here is a program showing this:</font></p>

          </font> <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Surprisingly,
        Newton's laws involving energy and inertia produce the same results as
        Euler's method, which is purely mathematical. Because Mr. Delmottes
        virtual medium can use both of them without any difference, and because
        Mr. Jocelyn Marcotte's algorithm also produces exactly the same anomaly,
        it turns out that the results are highly reliable.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">A quantum
        effect.</font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Euler's
        method is an approximation: it introduces some degree of error which is
        greater when the step is important as compared to the wavelength. The
        program above shows that the shorter the wavelength, the more unstable
        the curve.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Actually,
        this so-called error appears to be a true fact: genuine waves really
        behave like that. Each aether granule transmits energy step by step.
        This <b><i>discrete</i></b> procedure introduces quantum properties.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">On
        the one hand, the result is a slower wave if the wavelength is rather
        small with respect to the number of granules involved. On the other
        hand, standing waves produce a local granule concentration, where the
        wave speed is greater. Then all aether waves crossing such concentrated
        areas must undergo a lens effect.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">More electron
        properties unveiled.</font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">This
        anomaly fully explains why the electron frequency reaches a limit. It is
        the highest possible, and finally all electrons oscillate on the same
        very high frequency.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">It
        also explains the lens effect inside its standing wave nodes and
        antinodes, hence its amplification by constant surrounding aether waves
        incoming from all directions.&nbsp;</font></p>
