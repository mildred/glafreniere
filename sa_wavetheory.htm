        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Because
        any wave exerts a radiation pressure, the result is motion. This motion
        is energy. Because this energy as motion surely involves the Doppler effect, one should
        understand what is going on while a standing wave structure moves
        through aether. This leads to the Lorentz transformations.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">This
        means that standing waves inside matter must obey the Lorentz
        transformations. So matter itself must contract on its displacement axis. It must
        also slow down its evolution speed.</p>

        <p align="left"><b>Lorentz was right.</b></p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The
        Lorentz transformations were found by both Hendrik Lorentz and Henri
        Poincaré, who were very good friends. They worked on Woldemar Voigt's
        transformations for almost ten years, using Maxwell's equations, and
        they finally found the correct value in 1904.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"> Einstein made a mistake
        using the Lorentz transformations in order to build up his version of
        Relativity. He did not admit that aether was a must. He spoke about &quot;space contraction&quot; and &quot;time
        dilation&quot;. Definitely, this was a very weird and inane idea.&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Lorentz
        spoke about aether, matter contraction and clocks slowing down instead. I strongly believe that he was right. By
        May 2000 I
        wrote a French book about &quot;The
        theory of Absolute&quot;. I explained that the aether exists and that matter was
        made of standing waves. I also showed that Hendrik Lorentz explained
        Relativity far better than Albert Einstein did. However, nobody believed
        him because he could not explain why matter should transform this way.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Then I tried to understand what was
        wrong with Lorentz's formulas. I
        noticed that speed must be evaluated using space and time units. The
        point is that the Lorentz equations are already using space&nbsp;
        x&nbsp; and time&nbsp; t&nbsp; units, <b><i>plus</i></b> speed units and so space and
        time again. Clearly, any equation using such redundant values could not
        work properly. There should be something wrong about speed.</p>
        
        <p align="left"><b>The speed of light.</b></p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Lorentz's
        equations actually induce a wrong interpretation of Relativity because
        the speed of light is just &quot;c&quot; for both frames of reference,
        while space and time magnitudes are not the same. There is no c' speed.
        It is not possible to know for sure whether the speed of light is to be
        converted into x' and t' measures instead of x and t. In addition, x'
        and t' stand for distances and time in the frame of reference which is
        stationary. Using x and t for the stationary one would be more logical.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Because
        of this uncertainty, it is not possible to prefer the frame of reference
        which is stationary any more. Both frames are apparently equivalent. This page will show that one must use a
        stationary Cartesian
        frame of reference instead in order to respect Lorentz's
        ideas.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">However,
        the new set of equations will only show what will happen inside a moving
        system. Then it will be much more difficult to predict what a
        moving observer will see. As far as I know, <b><i>nobody</i></b>  made this
        calculation correctly. Poincaré noticed that such an observer
        could not know whether he was moving or not, and he first spoke about
        Relativity in 1904.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">But
        Lorentz was still sure about the aether. Fortunately, many people
        rediscover today this &quot;new&quot; Lorentzian Relativity.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Because
        matter is made of waves, one can today see that any motion should be the
        result of a series of longitudinal round trips or transverse zigzag
        displacements, whose speed is always that of the light.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Moreover
        Lorentz's equations indicate x values for space and t values for time.
        But they also indicate v and c values. Because any speed is the result
        of both x and t values, such values for speed appear to be redundant.
        One can simply remove them from Lorentz equations. And because it is not
        necessary to show a reciprocity, the new set of equations will be very
        simple:</p>

        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">From
        a mechanical point of view, matter works using waves whose speed is
        constant. The radiation pressure is a force inducing motion, and motion
        is energy. This happens because of the Doppler effect. Compressed waves
        contain more energy, in a way very similar to a &quot;subsonic boom&quot;.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">More
        energy inside matter means new mass in accordance with Einstein's famous equation :</p>
        
        <p align="center">E = mc<sup> 2</sup>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">It
        must be pointed out that Newton's equation (v is for velocity) for kinetic
        energy is :</p>
        
        <p align="center">E = mv<sup> 2</sup> / 2</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">However,
        this equation only shows <b><i>effective</i></b> kinetic energy. For
        slow speeds, the
        total energy involved is doubled. One can easily understand
        that a billiard ball can push another one, but it is also slowed down during
        the process. This <b><i> deceleration</i></b> obviously needs as much energy as is
        needed for accelerating the other ball. So the total energy involved
        during the process is given by:</p>

        page on wave mechanics shows that
        progressive waves must lose some of their energy while crossing
        standing waves. Because of the lens effect, a significant quantity of
        energy is transferred from aether waves to electrons. Then this energy
        as spherical wavelets is radiated by electrons. Because this
        amplification process weakens aether waves coming from any matter
        object, the waves become stronger in the opposite
        direction. This is the <b><i>shade effect.</i></b></p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">On
        the other hand, electrons radiate spherical wavelets containing exactly
        the same quantity of energy. Any aether wave exerts a radiation
        pressure. It can push all electrons inside matter. This pressure should
        compensate for the shade effect, but a very small difference can explain
        gravity.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">When
        two electrons are put close together, their waves are melting together, and
        this produces fields such as electrostatic or gluonic. Such a system
        radiates most of its energy along the axis. The result is a repulsive
        effect along the axis and an attractive effect in any other direction.

        &quot;gluons&quot; or gluonic fields. They are plane cylindrical standing
        wave
        systems which are also amplified by aether waves making their energy
        much more intense than that of one electron alone.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">It
        is a well known fact that collisions between positrons and electrons

        themselves. Huygens only spoke about wavelets originating from a wave

        produce a light beam and also an Airy disk at a certain distance. But

        simply wrong. In other words, one should play safe and <b><i>always</i></b>
        use Huygens' principle. Many animations and diagrams showed on this web

        computers reveal that spherical wavelets emitted by electrons can

        Those
        equations are much simpler than Lorentz's. The main difference is
        that <b><i> values are absolute</i></b> and referenced to the same frame, which is at
        rest.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Please
        pay attention to this: t' time is absolute because it is truly displayed
        by moving clocks, but it is nevertheless slower than t, which is the
        only absolute true time.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Those transformations
        are
        effective. They show the difference between any wave system dimensions
        and wave state while it is at rest and while it is moving. It should be emphasized
        that the true variable x concerns the electron's wavelength at rest; the
        true variable t concerns its phase at rest. There is no space/time
        effect. But one can suppose a matter entity (which is made of electrons)
        undergoing those changes as well; then the x and x'
        variables apply to distances between objects measured in light seconds,
        and t is measured in absolute seconds. Let's repeat because this was
        seldom understood in the past: despite the fact that it is absolute (it
        represents the time truly displayed by moving clocks), the t' time is
        two times slower here.&nbsp;</p>

        not only apply to clocks. From a mechanical point of view, this is
        necessary in order to cancel the waves' different speed forward and
        backward. Let's make it clear, this is not really a time effect, but
        rather a cause and effect distortion. Surprisingly, causes take place
        sooner at the rear of any moving system.</p>

        second later. This
        is obvious. However one should be wary of the obviousness. For example,
        one might think that using a rule which is contracted to half of its
        normal length, a moving observer would think that a 866 light second
        distance is 1732.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Absolutely
        not.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">In
        fact, it is exactly the opposite. A moving observer simply cannot
        measure a static distance correctly. The most common tool for measuring
        distances is the radar. However the speed of light will seem to be four
        times <b><i>faster</i></b> between two points at rest. Between two
        moving points, it is slowed down to 1/4 according to g ^ 2 (g = .5 here).</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Surprisingly,
        using a radar, this moving observer will observe that static objects are contracted and
        encountering the Lorentz transformations. A static observer will observe
        a moving one exactly in the same manner. There is a reciprocity, and
        finally, nobody can tell for sure which one is moving: this leads to Relativity.</p>

        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">So
        any observer moving at .866 c speed will think that a 866 light seconds
        (l/s) absolute distance is worth only 433 l/s. Not 1732 l/s. And he will also
        think that because he himself is at rest, the clock at rest is moving at
        .866 c and contracted to half of its normal length.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">In
        order to stay consistent with his space time system, he must then consider
        that his own clock must indicate 500 seconds instead of 1000 while the
        other clock is crossing the 866 l/s point. He simply thinks that it is
        the 433 l/s point.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">This
        is only a mathematical reasoning, but it was also demonstrated <b><i>mechanically</i></b> above. So things should really happen like this.</p>
        
        <p align="left"><b>There is no true reciprocity.</b></p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">On
        the other hand, this new set of equations certainly
        does not explain what a moving observer will see. Equations should first
        show what is going on, not what it looks like. Then one may transpose
        values in order to show what the illusion will be. And the illusion will
        definitely be Einstein's Special Relativity.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The point is that this analysis has never been
        done correctly. Among thousands of texts and books on this subject,
        nobody, I repeat <i><b>nobody</b></i> did note that Lorentz was right.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"> Einstein

        the gamma factor, which
