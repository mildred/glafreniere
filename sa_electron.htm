          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">While
          working on this, I already knew that matter and especially
          electrons should be made of spherical standing waves. I was also aware
          that such waves should undergo the Doppler effect, allowing them to
          move freely at variable speeds. However, I did not reveal this major
          discovery because I feared (I was wrong!) that a better knowledge of
          matter, considering the amazing forces involved, would lead us to a
          devastating Apocalypse. It is a well known fact that most discoveries such as
          radioactivity were always followed by more and more powerful weapons.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">I
          could never find any indication that this could be true for the wave
          nature of matter, though. So, in 2002, I wrote a book which was exempt
          of any mystery: Matter is made of Waves. It was not the case for
          another book written in 2000: The Theory of Absolute. I had to make it
          very evanescent about the wave nature of matter (it is not my
          discovery, but I was the first and I am still the only person who can
          explain all about it: electrons, matter, forces, mechanics). My goal
          was simply to restore Lorentz's Relativity, whose concept is <b><i>absolute.</i></b>
          Although this point of view leads to the same predictions as Einstein's,
          it should be emphasized that his Relativity, while it proves to be true,
          is nevertheless the result of our errors while recording phenomena.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">I
          discovered Mr. Milo Wolff's site in July 2003. Many observations
          appear to be correct, but I must strongly disapprove many of his ideas
          here, and especially the WSM (wave structure of matter) ideology using
          philosophy in order to make scientific discoveries. This is weird. But
          Milo was right at least in one point: his
          concentric spherical standing wave showed a full
          wavelength core. Both static and Doppler models, which I presented in 2002, showed
          only a
          half-wavelength core. This may seem strange, but exploring a new world
          is not obvious. I simply had not yet realized the similitude between
          the electron and the Airy disk.

          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The
          electron can move at any speed from 0 to nearly the speed of light

          Wolff never did.&nbsp;</p>
        
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">I
          also showed before anyone else the correct diagrams for it.
          Unfortunately, Mr. Marcotte's formulas were missing, but I succeeded
          anyway. As a matter of
          fact, the Huygens Principle is far more important and relevant as a
          tool. The results are a convincing proof that the system
          should behave this way.</p>

          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The
          electron's properties are well known. The list is astounding. It is so
          small that it has no apparent dimension. Its electrostatic charge is
          negative. There is
          also a positive antiparticle, the positron, which exhibits exactly the
          same properties except for the opposite charge. Its wave properties are now a well admitted fact. It can
          accelerate, slow down and change its direction. It can act and react
          as a result of an apparent contact, but also at a distance. It
          contains intrinsic energy according to mc^2, and additional kinetic energy
          according to m(gamma <font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="FR-CA" style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: FR-CA; mso-fareast-language: FR; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">–</span></font>

          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">In
          addition, the electron is the main player for a lot of phenomena such
          as magnetic and electric fields, light and radio waves emission, and
          chemical reactions. It can stabilize itself around the nucleus to form
          an atom, and it can bind molecules together. Finally, it is a well
          known fact that electron and
          positron collisions produce quarks and gluonic fields. This indicates that in
          this case electrons and positrons
          involved do
          not really annihilate. They should most likely be hidden but still present inside
          quarks and have their standing waves joined together as gluonic
          fields. This
          strongly suggests that matter (or any other particle) is solely made of electrons.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">This
        is a huge responsibility for so small a particle, but the electron
        magnificently takes up the challenge. This web site explains how it is
        possible.</p>

          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">So
          the electron appears to be the equivalent of a very
          special Airy disk whose aperture angle is 360°. As seen above, just one hemisphere
          becomes the source of traveling
          waves, but adding the opposite one rather produces standing waves.
          This is Milo Wolff's unmoving electron. Now let's see how the Doppler effect
          should transform it.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Using
          the Huygens Principle, I submitted all
          of Huygens' wavelets to a

          the first inventor, because square or sawtooth waves are propagating
          normally, while Delmotte's produces some sort of heat, a local
          vibration of the &quot;aether granules&quot;. This does not mean that
          it is better. It is simply different, but this suggests that many options
          are possible for an ideal aether. However, in both cases, sine
          waves behave normally, much like the sound propagates inside a solid

          computer programming, because he firstly had to handle the new <a href="http://fbide.sourceforge.net/category/freebasic/">FreeBASIC</a>
          programming language. He then immediately succeeded in testing my
          moving electron inside his own 3-D Virtual Aether. Among
          others, he also tested the evolution of a standard Gaussian impulse,
          and he seemed to be the only person on Earth who understood my Airy
          disk algorithm (up to now, just three people did).
          By March 2006, he informed me that Milo Wolff's static electron could
          be represented using the equation below where x stands for phase, distance
          or delay in radians:&nbsp; x = 2 * pi * distance / lambda. Then

          is a well known equation in the math literature. It is also known as
          the sinc(x) function, which is short for sinus cardinalis. But it had never been

          singularity for x = 0, y = 1 is also well established. I
          was using the equivalent since the beginning:&nbsp; y = sin(2 * pi * distance / lambda) / distance. The distance
          (x is more exactly the phase as a result of the delay) not being in radians, the wave shape for the electron

          have moved from x = 0 to x = .866 light-seconds (sin 60° = .866)
          after a one second delay. This is quite obvious: a speed of .866

          infinite number of &quot;granules&quot;, which can vibrate in
          accordance with Hooke's law. Thus those granules must initially
          contain kinetic energy, and also inertia, which can be seen as a memory of its
          precedent energy. In addition, this energy can be transmitted to the

          succeeded in experimenting my Doppler moving electron. Even better, he used the Lorentz transformations
          in order to reproduce the Doppler effect. Those
          transformations are not about a space-time distortion. They more
          simply predict the way on-axis waves contract and exhibit local phases producing a
          &quot;phase wave&quot;. Mr. Marcotte used his own
          Virtual Aether algorithm (see <a href="programs/WaveMechanics04.bas">WaveMechanics04.bas</a>), which is different from Mr.

          my opinion, this experiment will be related in the future as a

          aether waves. Traveling waves penetrating through standing wave
          antinodes are deviated because of a

          the radiation pressure mechanism can overcome this problem. Waves
          emitted by an electron will inevitably encounter those incoming from

          produce a very special set of standing waves, a <a href="sa_fields.htm">field

          electron. And because their phase and wavelength do not
          necessarily coincide, the electron will progressively change its
          position according to them.</p>
        
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Because
          the wave's amplitude is higher near the center, it turns out that half

          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The

          number of Huygens' wavelets. According to Huygens, the wavelets'
          addition must create a wave front wherever their phases coincide.
          Clearly, incoming wavelets can produce standing waves, but outgoing
          ones can only produce outgoing wavefronts.</p>
        
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">It
        turns out that the wavelets' summation, hence new energy, is far greater

        exhibit nodes where the medium pressure remains constant, and antinodes where
        negative and positive energy alternate. They produce regularly spaced nodes and

        medium pressure is the same everywhere and the system seems to

        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The

        at a given x coordinate, another perfectly
        synchronized system placed crosswise can rather
        produce a negative antinode there. Both systems being identical, their pulsating period is not for an

        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">So
        this is a <b><i>relative</i></b> point of view. All electrons are
        perfectly identical, but their unique central antinode is a privileged one. The amplitude there can
        be positive while it is negative inside another one, although all
        antinodes will be present simultaneously.
        
        </p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">This means that while one
        core is positive,
        another one can be negative. In other words, its phase&nbsp; is pi
        shifted with respect to the other one. In the meantime, all other antinodes
        are present, but their position is lambda / 2 shifted. Finally, two sorts of electron are possible. The electron spin does not refer to a
        mechanical rotation. It is the consequence of a <b><i>phase rotation</i></b>,
        and in order to achieve this all electrons must be perfectly synchronized.

        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">In
        addition, two times per period, such synchronized standing waves seem
        to disappear because the medium pressure is uniform everywhere. This is
        called quadrature, which can be either pi / 2 or 3 pi / 2. This
        indicates that there is some place for two other particles, two sorts of
        positrons, whose antinodes also appear simultaneously.

        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"> Assuming that electrons can synchronize
        themselves mutually, all positrons in the vicinity will less or more
        rapidly transform their phase and become electrons. The atomic structure
        makes it so that electrons are always nearer one from another, while
        positrons are also grouped. Moreover, the <a href="sa_protons.htm">proton</a>
        structure supposes that its three quarks should produce a pi / 2 phase
        shift in its center, making a hidden positron very stable and comfortable there.

        made of two hydrogen atoms. Because it is not magnetic, it should
        contain two electrons whose spin is +1/2 and <font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="FR-CA" style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: FR-CA; mso-fareast-language: FR; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">–</span></font>1/2.</p>

        quarks perfectly fit inside the Airy disk structure. And they very
        likely should alternate in order to minimize the proton's repulsive
        charge. Except for the positive charge, which may be explained by the
        presence or an additional positron, protons and neutrons are almost identical because they contain
        three quarks. Their mass is also quite similar. A quark is made of two electrons unified by a gluonic
        field. Finally, because the black zones are radiation-free, they are the
        perfect place for capturing those electrons.

        very hard to figure out because the gluonic field energy distribution is

        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The radius is
        probably that of a quark, although it could also be that of the whole atom

        containing 200 protons and neutrons consist of about 1200 electrons
        regularly spaced inside a 3-D space) indicate that the basic diffraction
        pattern for only 4 emitters, assuming that they are placed crosswise, may be superimposed and

        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">So
        the best way to obtain the electron wavelength will be to investigate multiple and synchronized emitters

          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">In
          1921, Otto Stern and Walter Gerlach conducted an experiment using fast
          moving silver atoms (47 electrons and protons) passing through a
          magnetic field. The goal was to examine how the last unpaired electron
          would behave. They found that the magnetic field separates the beam
          into two distinct parts. They thought that this indicated &quot;two
          possible orientations of the electron&quot;.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">In
          1925, Samuel A goudsmith and George E. Uhlenbeck proposed that the
          electron had an intrinsic angular momentum and the word
          &quot;spin&quot; rapidly followed. A similar spin was also attributed
          to the proton and even to its three quarks as a &quot;fractional&quot;
          and &quot;colored&quot; charge.&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">This
          is ridiculous because the electron alone does not behave like this. A
          silver atom behave as a whole, as well a the hydrogen atom, whose
          unique electron is also unpaired, hence magnetic.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">As

          and quite uncertain interpretation. After all, magnetic fields remain
          a totally unexplainable phenomenon, and the electron structure and
          mechanism as well. In front of so many uncertainties, one should
          definitely be more careful and doubtful.</p>

          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Let
          us face it: the electron structure and mechanism
          is still totally unknown. Most (not to say all) of physical phenomena
          such as magnetic fields also remain unexplained. Facing such a situation,
          one should think a lot about it and, if possible, propose some
          hypotheses. This web site does propose a full set of them, which
          suppose that matter is made of waves.
          Because it is the only mechanically acceptable theory up to now, it cannot be ignored any longer.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">This theory
          seems suspicious mainly
          because it is not consistent with today's false but well accepted
          ideas such
          as electromagnetic waves or photons. The problem here is
          certitude. Why are most scientists so confident about their
          knowledge? There should be a place for doubt. Haven't they ever heard
          of Descartes?</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">The scientific world is facing an enormous
          problem: it is stuck in a blind alley. Many well accepted ideas are simply false, and the sum of them is an
          impediment to new
          discoveries. For example, Maxwell presented his equations on
          &quot;electromagnetic waves&quot; in 1873. Surprisingly, all scientists
          immediately agreed with that. This attitude is unacceptable. Maxwell
          just forged a set of equations. <b><i>He never showed</i></b> that
          electric and magnetic fields could really travel through space at the speed of
          light. He never explained the true nature and mechanism of electric
          and magnetic fields. And finally subsequent physicists accepted
          Einstein's idea that those fields should be packed inside photons and
          that they could move at the same speed in any frame of reference (no
          aether needed for this pure contradiction!).</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Let's
          be clear: electromagnetic waves do not exist. Fresnel tried to explain
          polarization but failed (one more error): there is no aether
          transverse vibrations. The light is made of regular longitudinal traveling waves, but
          it is emitted by at least two particles. Suppose that one emitter is
          moving in a circular motion while
          another one emits a perfectly synchronized signal. Then the
          interference pattern must undulate. The undulation plane determines
          the polarization. What's more, the frequency is that of the undulations,
          not that of the electrons. It is a <b><i>secondary frequency</i></b>.
          In spite of the electron's unique very high frequency, lower frequencies
          become
          possible on a very large spectrum from very low radio frequencies up to gamma rays.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"> Maxwell's
          equations yield correct results because those electric and magnetic
          fields are virtually present inside radio waves. Because the phase
          is undulating, the electron waves can indeed produce such fields when they encounter some matter. They
          simply reproduce the same electron
          motion which was going on during the emission. Except for the square
          of the distance law, the emission and
          reception process is perfectly symmetric.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">So all happens as
          though magnetic fields were traveling. But they are not.</p>

          Relativity proves to be true, but it is the
          consequence of our inevitable errors. It is false from an absolute point of view. There is no
          true Relativity because Galileo's Relativity Principle is wrong. Let's be
          realistic: space simply cannot contract. Lorentz's
          Relativity is totally true, though, and it should be clear that the aether is not just
          a preferred frame of reference. It is the only one, it is Cartesian,
          not Galilean, and it is absolute. In addition, Relativity does not
          involve gravity, and gravity cannot bend space (did you really believe
          that?). Non-euclidian geometry is
          false. So there is no &quot;general Relativity&quot;.</p>

          And because all of its properties strongly suggest that it could be an
