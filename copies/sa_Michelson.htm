        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">One
        should be aware that, prior to the Lorentz transformation, Michelson
        discovered a mechanical property of waves while they are evolving inside
        a moving frame of reference. This is the Michelson transformation, which
        involves a contraction on both transverse y and z axis, but also a more
        severe one along the motion x axis. Moreover such a transformation does
        not produce any time effect:</p>
        <p align="center">x '&nbsp; =&nbsp; (x <font size="4"><span style="letter-spacing: 0"><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: FR-CA; mso-fareast-language: FR; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"> –</span>

        <p align="center">t '&nbsp; =&nbsp; t</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">According
        to our example, planes flying inside such a contracted space would
        perform a complete round trip in the same time (two hours) whatever the
        speed of wind or its direction. This explains why no time effect occurs.
        Such a contraction also cancels the speed difference on any orthogonal
        axis. There is no winner any more.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">So
        the main difference between Michelson's transformation and Lorentz's one
        is the time effect. Both should yield a null result for the
        interferometer.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Galileo's
        transformation does involve a time effect (albeit all authors still put
        down t' = t), but there is no contraction. This transformation is not
        likely to work for mechanical reasons. Because matter behaves like
        waves, it is simply false.</p>
 </font>
        <p align="left"><b>A race between two waves.</b></p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Michelson
        discovered that the relative speed of light is slower in the direction
        of motion. He deduced from this that an interferometer could detect the
        speed of aether wind. He understood that two orthogonal light beams
        would not produce the same interference fringes after a 90° rotation.
        Here is a diagram showing Michelson's apparatus:</p>

        both beams could be compared inside a special scope. Michelson was

        destructively, showing a characteristic interference pattern. <span lang="FR-CA">The
        goal was to measure the fringes displacement after a 90° rotation. Such

        the same reason, any observer placed in the system's centre O, and using

        he would not notice that the signal round trip time is two times longer

        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Because
        matter is made of waves, all its mechanisms are also slowed down. It is
        evolving slower. Most often, one speaks about <b><i>time dilation</i></b>.
        This is a huge mistake. The time is a concept, an idea. It does not
        really exist. A clock does, and it can tick two times slower. This does
        not mean that the time runs slower.&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Secondly,
        planes or waves would reach the A point on the rear much more rapidly.
        Because of the Doppler effect, the B point will be attained later. Henri
        Poincare showed that inside such a system, the central O observer must
        use light or radio signals in order to synchronize A and B clocks.
        Because the signal speed is much faster backward, the A clock will be in
        advance and B clock will be late. However nobody would be able to notice
        the resulting time shift. Inside such a moving frame of reference,
        Poincaré showed that <b><i>local hours</i></b> lead to a sort of
        virtual simultaneity. Nobody can measure the frame's actual speed. It
        all happens as if the system was perfectly at rest inside aether.</p>

        The wavelength ranges from 1 to 2 backward while it can be infinitely
        compressed frontward. The waves compression is much more severe. On the
        other hand energy is proportional to frequency. Because waves contain
        energy, and because matter as waves also contains energy as mass, moving
        matter must increase its energy according to the gamma factor. So
        matter's mass is doubled for .866 c.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">So
        this was the secret: matter is made of waves. 100
        years were needed in order to solve this mystery. This was obvious,
        though, because Lorentz established his equations while working on
        Maxwell's equations. The Lorentz transformation is linked to the Doppler

        <p align="left"><b>The standing waves contraction.</b></p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Very
        few people noticed that because the light waves are reflected back on
        flat mirrors, this produces standing waves inside both branches.
        Moreover standing waves compression is not a well known phenomenon. As
        far as I know it seems to have been discovered by <a href="http://www.keelynet.com/spider/b-104e.htm">Mr.
        Yuri Ivanov</a> in 1990, and nobody else (except for me and <a href="http://members.aol.com/scabala25/index.htm">Mr.
        Serge Cabala</a>) seems to have studied it in an acceptable manner. For
        more details about pseudo-standing waves or &quot;lively standing

        I managed to add some reference marks along both branches in order to
        locate the nodes position. It should be pointed out that such nodes are
        still present in the direction of motion, notwithstanding the fact that
        the wavelength is two times longer while the waves are traveling
        backward. This is possible because those waves also seem to travel two
        times faster. One needs a little concentration to observe this, but it
        finally becomes obvious.</span><p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"> <span lang="FR-CA">On
        the other hand the mean relative velocity of light in order to perform a
        complete round-trip can be calculated as shown above. The waves behave
        exactly in the same manner as planes while the wind is blowing. So the
        calculus is very simple:</span><p align="center">Mean velocity along the

        the standing waves compression is worth the relative velocity or light.
        Both calculus yield the same results. Michelson did not use this method,
        but it is indeed a much preferable one.&nbsp;</span>

        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="FR-CA">In
        1892, </span> George F. FitzGerald postulated that Michelson's
        interferometer should contract in order to cancel the phase shift. He
        also tried to explain this phenomenon by aether's pressure. His
        discovery was never published (FitzGerald was not sure) and Hendrik A. Lorentz
        also independently discovered that matter should contract. He also
        discovered a time effect.<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">FitzGerald
        and Lorentz were unaware of matter's wave properties, but it is a well
        known fact since de Broglie's discovery. From this very moment
        scientists could establish the relationship with standing waves
        contraction.<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Today
        one can postulate that matter is purely made out of standing waves. Then
        Michelson's interferometer should indeed contract and cancel the phase
        shift because the light waves behave exactly the same way as matter
        waves do.<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">In
        1904, Lorentz et Henri Poincaré finally found the correct&nbsp; g&nbsp;
        contraction value. There is no transverse contraction. They also showed
        that a time shift should occur, and that moving clocks should slow down.
        This is the Lorentz transformation. Lorentz's equations are famous today
        because they led to Relativity.<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Matter
