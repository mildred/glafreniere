          are many reasons why Relativity holds true. The absence of transverse
          contraction according to Lorentz's discovery is definitely the most
          important one. Such a result, which is the main characteristic of the
          Relativistic Doppler effect, implies a slower pulsation rate according
          to Lorentz's time equation. The well-known Lorentz-FitzGerald
          longitudinal contraction and Lorentz's &quot;local time&quot; are also
          of the utmost importance when it comes to explaining Relativity.</span></font></p>

          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
          problem is that the Lorentz Transformations are misleading. They must
          be applied to a moving system because the x' and t' variables refer to
          stationary one. Instead of space and time units, the variables should
          rather be given in wavelength and phase units. In addition, Voigt, Lorentz,
          Poincare, and Larmor had to elaborate complicated demonstrations using
          Maxwell's equations. As a matter of fact, Lorentz himself wrote in
          1920 that less than 10 physicists in the whole world were able to
          explain Relativity. Today, it is even worse, and that is why most
          astronomers no longer rely on elementary Relativity in order to
          understand the Big Bang and the expansion of the Universe.</span></font></p>

          I could elaborate a more practical equation set which applies to <a href="sa_plane.htm">Ivanov's
          standing waves</a>. Because it may be applied to sound waves with
          similar results, the use of
          Maxwell's equations is no longer relevant. I called this equation set
          the Alpha transformations because it is the very basis of matter
          mechanics, which is known to be the Wave Mechanics since Louis de
          Broglie. Although they primarily reflect the behavior of standing
          waves, their reversed form is surprisingly very similar to the
          original Lorentz
          transformations, which apply to matter.</span></font></p>

          wave addition method because, at least theoretically, it is the superimposition of
          two waves trains traveling in opposite direction and whose wavelength
          differ. Ivanov's waves may also be reproduced using my <a href="sa_scanner.htm">Time

          first glance, this phenomenon might not look that important. However,
          it can be shown that it is closely related to the Lorentz
          Transformations. The node and antinode structure is moving at the
          &quot;alpha&quot; speed in the direction of the shorter waves so that
          its intrinsic energy is also moving at the alpha speed. Especially, as
          it was explained above, this system exhibits a slower pulsation rate
          and a longitudinal contraction with respect to the wavelength
          geometrical mean. What's more, because of the presence
          of a stunning phase wave, a series of clocks regulated according to
          the local phase would obviously display Lorentz's &quot;local
          time&quot;. Such effects are indeed identical to those of the Lorentz
          Transformations.</span></font></p>

          point is that today's astronomers do not believe that remote galaxies
          are undergoing the Lorentz transformations. In their picture, because
          the Universe is expanding, galaxies are practically stationary with
          respect to the local &quot;space fabric&quot;. This is known as the
          &quot;raisin pudding model&quot;. Thus, even though we are surely not
          in the center of the Universe, we are still observing that all
          galaxies around us are receding according to Hubble's law.&nbsp;</span></font></p>

          though, because Relativity always holds true. It does not tolerate any
          exception. Astronomers are aware that today's instruments and
          methods are amazingly accurate, so that relativistic speeds are no
          longer necessary in order to verify it. Especially, the speed of a
          moving space ship as measured from another one is verifiable using a
          Doppler radar. Hence, they must realize that some new crucial
          experiences are already possible. They should examine more carefully
          the Relativistic Big Bang hypothesis, simply because it will soon be
          verified.</span></font></p>

          of time, and that is why the resulting Doppler effect is relativistic.</span></font></p>

          not acceptable to deal with a so-called &quot;z&quot; redshift, which
          is given by the wavelength ratio minus 1 in order to indicate the beta
          (or v / c) speed. Using the more acceptable redshift R shown above,

          1842 that this difference is unnoticeable if the observer is moving
          along with the transmitter. In this case, Ivanov's waves are moving at
          the same speed. The video below shows that this fundamental result is
          consistent with both the acoustic and relativistic Doppler effect.</span></font></p>

          turns out that the x axis is a preferred one, where Lorentz's t' phase (or time)
          applies and where the Lorentz-FitzGerald contraction takes place using
          Lorentz's original contraction factor. The y axis is involving a secondary
          level of transformation as seen by the observer moving on the x axis.
          Similarly, the transformation on the z axis is a tertiary one as seen
          by an observer moving on both x and y axes. Thus, the all-azimuth
          transformations shown below are asymmetric. Fortunately, it is possible
          to bypass this constraint by accelerating the speed according
          to beta[y] / g[x] or beta[z] / g[y] in order to obtain symmetrical
          results, for example if the goal is to obtain a 45° direction. Of
          course, it is also possible to elaborate a different equation set in order to obtain
          symmetrical results, but this option proves to
          be far more complicated. It also leads to speeds faster than light,

          unattainable. This is why the purple curve strongly deviates from the
          blue one when it approaches c. But surprisingly, although the well-known regular

          center of the Universe would become verifiable. The answer to this
          ultimate question is well beyond our reach today because there are so
          many variables and hypotheses. Especially, a severe redshift is difficult to measure
          because the radiation energy is dimming proportionally. Considering

          may be actually about 27 billion light-years away. One should
          nevertheless be aware that such a distortion as a result of the light
          traveling delay must imperatively be perceived as a space contraction
          which partially accounts for the Lorentz-FitzGerald contraction. In
          addition, though, because the aether is expanding at the speed of
          light, the light emitted toward us by those galaxies is no longer
          capable of reaching our telescopes.</span></font></p>

          this area, the speed of light with respect to us is very slow. Hence,
          their actual distance would be far greater than 27 billion light-years
          away. That is why the result is finally comparable to that of a pure
