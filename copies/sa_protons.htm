        the proton finally contains only six electrons plus one positron, which act like
        emitting antennas fed in phase, in quadrature or in phase opposition. The
        diagrams for six emitting devices on a octahedron
        structure appears to be quite different and much more complex then that
        of the laser. They especially show eight stunning &quot;black funnels&quot; which should be equally spaced, with their origin on the <b><i>
        eight vertices of a cube.</i></b> They explain the constant 8-electron external
        atomic shell.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Because
        of the amplification process, the electron seems always attracted (it
        actually is pushed from the opposite direction) by any zone where the
        wave energy is weaker. Inside a heavy atom, many electrons will firstly
        fill the inner atomic shells, but then up to eight more electrons will stay inside those black funnels.
        This will happen only if there
        are not enough electrons inside the inner atomic shells to balance the
        positive charge of the protons.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">This strongly indicates that all atoms have a
        virtual cubic structure, explaining the Mendeleev 8-periodic
        classification of elements. This should greatly improve researches in chemistry.
        While some electrons are absent from those eight funnels,
        electrons from another atom, preferably containing less electrons
        inside those funnels, will try to fill the empty ones. So, up to four electrons can
        be involved in the same chemical binding.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">I
        still did not investigate the correct distances because, while
        displaying millions of wavelengths, my method leads to a
        lot of display artifacts which I will have to overcome. The solution
        should be some kind of randomly distributed samples or the standard
        bell-shaped distribution. So the
        diagram below is partially wrong. However the true one should show some similar
        patterns. As far as I know, the eight conic &quot;black funnels&quot;

        15 gluonic fields as plane standing waves are strongly amplified by
        aether waves. They should radiate their energy according to the same
        wave patterns. However it should be much stronger along the gluonic
        field axis, and much weaker along the eight funnels axis. This means
        that the &quot;black funnels&quot; should be even darker, enabling them
        to capture electrons.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"> The wave amplitude is null or almost null inside
        those zones, and so they should try to capture any electron wandering in the
        vicinity. The great number of protons inside very heavy atoms does not
        change this because they always align themselves on the same three axis.
        They only reinforce the patterns without changing them.
        This explains why all atoms cannot contain more then eight electrons on
        their external atomic shell.</p>

        wave mechanics does not indicate any other force then magnetic fields
        which could be capable of joining up to 100 positive protons inside a
        complex atom nucleus. So let's assume that all those protons need strong
        magnetic fields in order to overcome their electrostatic charge.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">There
        is no magnetic field unless the electron and the positron are distant
        from a lambda multiple integer plus or minus lambda / 4. On the other
        hand two electrons which spin is not the same must be distant from an
        additional lambda / 2 in order to produce the positron pi / 2 phase
        shift. This indicates that a quark must contain two electrons from both
        spins in order to be magnetic. Only one quark from this sort is
        possible. Two other non-magnetic quarks are also possible. They may
        contain two +1/2 or two -1/2 electrons. And finally, the anti-quarks
        contain the equivalent positrons instead of electrons.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">This
        one-way magnetic radiation explains why scientists have &quot;seen&quot;
        up and down quarks while the three electron pairs are
        fundamentally similar. There are three main axis and only 1 or 2 out of
        3 can exhibit the same pole simultaneously. There is no positron inside
        the neutron, but it still contains 15 gluonic fields which phase is that
        of the positron. So the result should be the same while just one quark contains
        two electrons from the same spin instead of opposite: a one-way radiation beam. On the
        other hand, there is a true positron inside the proton. This
        should produce more magnetic fields and cause the spin from one or two
        electrons to be different from those inside the neutron.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">It
        should be emphasized that X-Rays and even gamma rays wavelength is still
        much greater than a quark. The best way to &quot;observe&quot; the
        proton and its quarks should be to use electrons as projectiles. They
        are indeed smaller then protons and quarks. But one should be very
        careful in drawing conclusions. It is quite obvious that small
        projectiles inside a narrow beam are likely to be separated into three
        beams while hitting a cube. It would be very insane to deduct from this
        that a cube contains three components.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Finally,
        most of our knowledge about protons and quarks appear quite uncertain. The three quarks as independent entities should
        almost be forgotten. There are six electrons instead,
        albeit there are indeed three units placed crosswise on the
        three Cartesian axis.</p>
        
        <p align="left"><b>Following Mrs. Thompson's path.</b></p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Starting
        from the principle that nature hates small complicated things, but love
        complex big ones, I tried to find
        how only three electrons should behave. They would certainly be more
        stable than just two electrons because the gluonic fields can act on
        them as an attractive force. Unfortunately there is only one gluon attracting
        each electron. This particle does not contain a positron in its center
        because it could escape. It could be a muon because it is
        polarized (just one plane radiating on both sides). The antiparticle
        (three positrons) is also possible, albeit the normal
        muon is known to be negative.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Then I examined the 4-electrons model.
        The tetrahedron is indeed a very interesting hypothesis, as <a href="http://freespace.virgin.net/ch.thompson1/Essays/PWA.pdf"> Mrs.

        phase.&nbsp;As far as I know, this was the first

        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"> Because the
        proton's D
        diameter and the second external atomic shell distance L are already well known, this
        should enable us to calculate the electron <font face="Symbol" size="4">l</font>
        wavelength. Unfortunately, this cannot be done with accuracy. One can make a great number of wave diagrams using 6 to 100
        electrons as a proton and find that the <b><i>farthest</i></b> distance
        L where those low intensity zones can appear is worth exactly:&nbsp; L = D<sup> 2</sup> /
        4 <font face="Symbol" size="4">l</font>. This is also the case for the
        laser beam and there is a link to Fresnel's number, which is worth 1
        exactly here.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">So
        the minimum electron wavelength should be
        worth:</p>
        <p align="center">Atom diameter:&nbsp; L = 10<sup> <b>-8</b></sup></p>
        
        <p align="center">Proton diameter:&nbsp; D = 10<sup> <b>-15</b></sup></p>
        
        <p align="center">Formula:&nbsp; <font face="Symbol" size="4">l</font>
        = D<sup> 2</sup> / 4 L</p>
        
        <p align="center">Electron wavelength, minimum:&nbsp; <font face="Symbol" size="4">l
        </font>
        = 2.5 * 10<sup> <b>-23</b></sup>
        </p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The
        electron wavelength simply cannot be smaller. This
        is very small, but in comparison the so-called Planck's scale (10<sup> <b>-32</b></sup>) was certainly misleading. It was much
        too small.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">However,
        with the above 6-electron proton model, the low amplitudes zones can
        appear for about 100 times smaller distances. So the electron wavelength could be up to
        100 times larger: (10<sup>  <b>-21</b></sup>). This
        also indicates that the distance between two electrons inside a quark
        (or
        the proton diameter, or the quark length) should be worth:</p>
        <p align="center"> 10<sup> <b>-15</b></sup>
        / 10<sup> <b>-23</b></sup>&nbsp; =&nbsp; about 1 000 000 to 100 000 000 electron
        wavelengths.</p>
        
        <p align="left"><b>The proton contains a positron.</b></p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">My
        wave mechanics shows that all the electrons in the same vicinity
        should synchronize themselves. Free positrons should then simply
        transform to electrons after a small delay because they are surrounded by negative phased
        standing waves. However the neutron's center is filled with three
        crosswise very intense gluonic fields as standing waves, which phase is 1/4 lambda shifted.
        Because the positron is also 1/4 lambda shifted, it will fit perfectly
        in the middle of a proton,&nbsp; making it positive and magnetic without creating any
        additional gluonic field.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Moreover
        the neutron contains six negative electrons and it still is neutral.
        This indicates that something inside it should radiate the lambda/4
        opposite phase, and it clearly appears to be the gluonic fields.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The
        positron will also create magnetic fields,
        enabling several protons to overcome their electrostatic force and bind together inside heavier elements
        up to radioactive ones such as plutonium. There is a limit because magnetic fields
        decrease roughly according to the cube of the distance. This can be done with
        the help of intermediate neutrons as buffers, but I still cannot explain
        how. And because there are two
        spins for positrons, there are also two spins for protons, which phase
        related to&nbsp; 2 pi&nbsp; is 0 and 1 as compared to +1/2 and -1/2 for the electrons.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">This
        explains the presence of the positron in the middle of the proton, as a
        possible but not compulsory alternative. The proton is then even more
        stable (and probably a bit smaller) then the neutron because the positron maintains an additional attractive force on
        all six electrons:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
