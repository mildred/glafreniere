        <p style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In
        March 2004, I invented a scanner which is capable or reproducing the </font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> Lorentz
        transformations. The goal was to scan an animated scene in such a way that
        Lorentz's contraction occurs. Moreover, a scanner produces an image
        where events did not occur at the same time. I managed to scan the scene at different times which match Lorentz's
        famous local time, and this is why I called this device &quot;the Time Scanner&quot;.</font>
        <p style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The Time
        Scanner produces a Doppler effect which is clearly visible above.
        However, it may correct the Doppler effect as well. Such a
        reversibility is also the main characteristic of the Lorentz
        transformations. It was pointed out by Henri Poincare in 1904.</font>
        <p style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">As
        shown in the above animation, moving clocks indicate different times
        along the line of motion. This local time was discovered by Lorentz
        himself, albeit it could be deduced from Voigt's equations. Many successive
        images produced this way and displayed as a movie clip would reveal that
        the emitter frequency and the equivalent seconds would be slowed down
        according to Lorentz's contraction factor g. This was called
        &quot;time dilation&quot; but actually, moving clocks cannot transform
        time. They just tick slower. In addition, thanks to the vertical scale,
        one can check that the wavelength remains constant perpendicularly to
        the line of motion: y' =
        y; z' = z.
        Because the regular Doppler effect produces a wavelength
        contraction transversally, this slower Doppler effect is obviously a very special
        one.</font><p style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">And
        finally, if the scene contains a lot of material bodies or emitters
        whose speed and direction is not the same, the Time Scanner is still capable
        of transforming all of them as if they were in a faster or in a slower
        frame of reference. It is capable of performing an unlimited number of
        transformations on an unlimited number of coordinates. Not just one at a
        time. It may also scan an entire 3-D scene, the scanner being a moving
        plane.</font><p style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Lorentz's
        equations simply cannot achieve such a complex result in just one
        operation. The Time Scanner proves to be the ultimate tool in order to
        study motion mechanics, motion optics, the <a href="sa_Lorentz.htm">Lorentz
        transformations</a>, and <a href="sa_relativity.htm"> Relativity.</a></font>
        <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><b>A moving
        observer is fooled by the Doppler effect.</b></font></p>
        <p style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">It
        should be well understood that because
        of the Doppler effect, the distance being equal, events observed at the
        rear occurred sooner. They are perceived later because the relative
        velocity of the waves propagating forward is slower: v' = v * (1 + beta).
        It is faster backward: v' = v * (1 <span lang="FR-CA" style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: FR-CA; mso-fareast-language: FR; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">–</span>
        beta). The moving observer is unaware of this. He doesn't know anything
        about his movement and hence, he believes to be at rest. So the time
        shift is only the consequence of his error after a clock synchronization
        procedure using radio waves whose velocity is similarly distorted. The Time Scanner may correct
        this error and show what is really going on.
        Inversely, it may rather introduce the error and show what the moving observer
        is seeing.</font>
        <p style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The
        Time Scanner is highly useful because there is no other way to show how
        optical phenomena should be seen by any moving observer whatever his
        speed. Strangely, he observes that a Doppler effect is present in a
        system at rest even though there is none. On the contrary, the Doppler
        effect being present in his own environment, he cannot detect it.</font>
        <p style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">And
        because matter consists of waves, the moving observer perceives matter
        itself according to the same rules. This is why a moving observer sees a
        material body being contracted, behaving slower, and exhibiting local
        hours even though it is stationary. As a matter of fact, most probably,
        both of them are moving with respect to the aether and their line of
        motion differ. But they can only record the speed difference because of
        this reciprocity.&nbsp;</font><p align="left"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><b>The Lorentz

Lorentz explained that the Michelson interferometer was undergoing a contraction
        whose effect was to cancel the speed difference along two orthogonal
        axes. It was shown in the previous page that he was aware that his
        equations were only a mathematical artifice. Woldemar Voigt's goal (in
        1887) was to modify Maxwell's equations in such a way that the results
        became invariant whatever the speed of the frame of reference. Except
        for Voigt's constant, Lorentz's equations were identical and they were
        also applied to Maxwell's equations. This is why his transformations do
        not indicate a contraction. They rather indicate longer x' coordinates
in order to restore the initial distances.</font><p style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">To
        cut a long story short,&nbsp; Lorentz's variables x and t should rather
        stand for distance and time in a frame of reference which is stationary.
        It appears rather illogic that they were applied to the moving frame of
        reference. So, in order to indicate matter contraction, Lorentz's
        equations must be reversed and transposed this way:</font>

        factor, which is given by 1 / g, was misleading. In order to clean up
        all this mess, the use of Lorentz's contraction factor g is preferable:</font>

        <p style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">This
        is the correct version of the Lorentz transformations. It is what
        Lorentz was well aware of. The aether exists and any speed should
        preferably be related to it. Facts, events are absolute but
        unfortunately, it turns out that they can never be observed in an
        absolute way. They always appear relative so that Relativity is just a mystification.&nbsp;</font><p style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">One
        must bear all this in mind while examining the Time Scanner.
        Transforming space and time was definitely a strange idea. The
        transformations occur solely because the electron frequency slows down.
        The Doppler effect produces a contraction (as a matter of fact, <a href="sa_plane.htm">standing
        waves</a> contract) along the displacement axis in spite of the longer
        overall wavelength. Matter structure is dependent on electrons. Even
        empty spaces inside and between material structures contract because the
        whole area is filled up with <a href="sa_fields.htm">fields of force</a>
        which are also made out of standing waves.</font><p style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Obviously,
        moving clocks cannot transform time. Their mechanism just slow down
        because of the slower electron frequency. They indicate slower seconds
        which are inaccurate with respect to standard time, which has been
        adopted as a convention. Such a time is absolute whatever the actual
        speed of the frame of reference where it is observed.</font><p style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">It
        was decided years ago that, in order to avoid the transformation of a
        material reference, whatever the cause, the meter length should be given
        by a wavelength and that the second duration should be given by a
        frequency. Some day the ultimate reference will be the electron
        wavelength and frequency. The electron wavelength reference is accurate
        at any speed at least along the y and z Cartesian axes according to
        Lorentz: y' = y; z' = z. In this context, Lorentz's x and x' variables
        do not apply to space. They rather apply to the electron standing waves
        along the displacement axis. The t and t' variables do not apply to
        time, they apply to the electron frequency.</font><p style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Einstein's
        Special Relativity was totally unable to reconcile more than two frames
        of Reference. Only two frames of reference were still quite hard to
        explain because the results lead to a lot of paradoxes. Contradictions,
        actually.</font><p style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The
        Time Scanner is free from paradoxes. It is capable of dealing with an
        unlimited number of frames of reference. It may accelerate the whole
        scene or slow it down as well. It especially shows that, in the presence
        of two frames of reference, one can introduce a third one whose speed is
        intermediate and where no contraction or time dilation occurs. For this
        reason, this frame of reference is a <b><i>preferred</i></b> one. This
        behavior is clearly visible in the animation shown above because the
        text and the stationary graphics do not change.</font><p style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Introducing space
        and time transformation was a mistake. Under certain conditions, they do not
        transform in spite of the fact that, nevertheless, material bodies still
        transform physically and mechanically according to Lorentz.</font><p style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Invoking
        such a strange hypothesis becomes unnecessary. Moreover, Euclidean geometry
        is simpler than non-Euclidean.</font> <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Frankly,

        consistent with Lorentz's calculus:
        y' = y; z' = z and additionally, it indicates that events in this moving

        equation set whose goal was to correct the Doppler effect when applied
        to Maxwell's equations. Unfortunately, he could not find the exact value
        of the constant, which equals 1 according to Lorentz. In addition, the constant was incorrectly placed in the
        t' equation. Below is the corrected and inverted version of the
        Voigt transformations. The frequency remains unchanged on the condition
        that Voigt's constant equals g.

        that, whatever the value of the constant might be, the Michelson
        interferometer should <b><i>expand or contract</i></b> in such a way
        that it should yield a null result. Apparently, it was Joseph Larmor who
        firstly suggested that no contraction should occur transversally, but
        his equations are not consistent with this assertion. As far as I know,
        it was Lorentz who firstly found that Voigt's constant k should be equal
        to 1 because this information was related in Poincare's book in 1901.
        However, Lorentz's work was published in 1904, well after Poincare came
        to the same conclusion by means of the &quot;least action
        Principle&quot;.<p style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">If k

        computer indicates that Voigt's and Lorentz's reversed equations as
        established above are correct because they produce a nice Doppler
        effect. On the contrary, they <b><i>do not</i></b> work correctly in
        their original form because they clumsily indicate an unnecessary

        consistent with Relativity.<p style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The
        point is that the Time Scanner produces a contraction which proves to be
        unavoidable. For example, I could show that, thanks to the
        Delmotte-Marcotte virtual medium, the parabola of a fast moving emitter
        must contract in order to correctly reflect the Doppler-transformed
        waves. The movie clip below is very clear on this fact:

        Poincare and Einstein made a serious error. The Time Scanner and the
        Delmotte-Marcotte virtual medium are powerful tools but unfortunately,
        they were missing at the epoch. Starting from now, thanks to them,

        which is commonly admitted in Lorentzian Relativity. The alpha speed is
        the intermediate speed between zero and beta, and this is why I named it
        &quot;alpha&quot;. However, because the speed scale is not a linear one,
        one must rely on Poincare's law of speed addition below:<p align="center">beta'' =

        the moving observers, the preferred frame of reference is moving at the
        alpha speed and the other one is moving at the beta speed. It will be

        and clocks are ticking at the same rate. This point of view appears more
        acceptable for all three observers although the train <b><i>or</i></b>
        the tunnel really becomes shorter because of its absolute faster motion.
        The good news is that there is no space-time transformation to consider
        any more. The same distance and time units should preferably be adopted
        as a universal convention but the transposition to every other frame of
        reference is still necessary in order to explain the <b><i>apparent</i></b>
        effects of the Lorentz transformations.</font><p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">This
        is why the relative speed of electrons or protons traveling in opposite
        directions in the Large Hadron Collider may reach nearly twice the speed
        of light. If the observer was moving along with them, their apparent
        relative speed would be nearly the speed of light only, hence <b><i>two
        times slower</i></b>. This point of view where the collider itself seems
        to move at the alpha speed appears less interesting, unacceptable
        actually.</font><p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">For
        the same reason, our galaxy must preferably considered to be immobile.
        This is important in order to explain why very distant galaxies are
        moving away from it in opposite directions at nearly the speed of light.
        If our galaxy was really moving at nearly the speed of light, it would
        be difficult to explain why some of them are nevertheless moving that
        fast in the same direction as it. There is still no certitude, but an
        acceptable consensus which is free from space or time transformations is
        better than a theory leading to unexplainable paradoxes.</font>

        <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The
        alpha speed will very likely be recognized as a major innovation. It
        explains Relativity without the need for transforming space and time and
        without being puzzled by paradoxes any more. It is the basis of two new
        sciences, motion mechanics and motion optics. It will lead to a
        comprehensive upgraded version of Lorentz's Relativity which will
        replace Einstein's General Relativity.</font>
        <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The
        remaining task will be to measure the effects of gravity and
        acceleration, which are equivalent according to Einstein. Those effects
        being measurable, this is no problem at all.</font></p>
        <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The
        important point is that the alpha speed is a real one. It is the speed
        of all <a href="sa_fields.htm">fields of force</a> because they are
        standing between two electrons or other particles and hence, between two
        moving pieces of matter. From this point of view, Newton's laws still
        hold true in spite of the Lorentz transformations. The Lorentz force for
        example becomes much more understandable because moving electrons are
        oscillating slower. The addition to waves emitted by unmoving electrons
        produces a phase rotation which explains very well all electromagnetic
        phenomena.</font></p>

        the fact that, in order to verify their age difference without any
        doubt, the twins must be reunified. Then the question is: where will
        they meet? At least one of them must decelerate and/or accelerate and in

        un ralentissement. Mais &quot;l'observateur alpha&quot; peut facilement
        chiffrer la modification de vitesse qui s'ensuit de son point de vue. Il
        peut donc chiffrer aussi les variations dans l'heure que les horloges

        ils arriveront néanmoins au même moment auprès de l'observateur alpha

        the Scanner cancels the Doppler effect, so it is consistent with

        performs the opposite effects. It is possible
        because the Lorentz transformations are perfectly reversible. Reversing the scan direction reverses the results the same way
        Henri Poincaré found for Lorentz's equations (see also below). Then the
        Time Scanner cancels the
        transformations, hence the Doppler effect, but also the contraction and
        the phase/time shift. So it produces exactly the same effects as Lorentz's original equations,
        whose purpose was to
        achieve Maxwell's
        equations invariance.</font>

          the
