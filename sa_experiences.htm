        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The
        above diagram is a flawless demonstration that Lorentz's contraction
        really occurs for optical phenomena. In spite of the Doppler effect, the Fresnel-Fraunhofer diffraction pattern
        proves to remain
      perfectly symmetric in such a way that motion cannot be detected. Those
        results are possible thanks to Mr. Philippe
      Delmotte's and Jocelyn Marcotte's virtual medium, which is a powerful laboratory. The results are not disputable because they can also be
        reproduced using true physical devices and true waves such as the sound
        waves. They are much easier to obtain using the computer, though.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The
        important point is that today's computers are amazingly fast and
        reliable. Especially, it becomes clear
        that Lorentz's Relativity, which is based on the existence of a
        preferred frame of reference (the aether) and on actual matter contraction,
        will replace Einstein's because it also explains matter mechanics. This
        will lead us well beyond a mere Relativity effect.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The
        more our skill is improving, the more we are capable of making <b><i>experiences</i></b>.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">In
        addition, Lorentz's Relativity strongly suggests that matter is made of
        waves. The
        Wave Nature of Matter is on its way to be demonstrated.

          recently, we worked hard to obtain the best results from this virtual

          our images are quite smooth and natural.&nbsp;</font></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Below
          are several new improved video clips showing how light travels in the
          Michelson Interferometer. There is a choice of two velocities.
          Firstly, half of the speed of light or 0.5 c, and secondly, 0.7 c.
          Transverse waves are tilted to an angle which is given by: arc sin
          (v/c), that is 30° and 45°. This behavior proves to be highly
          consistent with the Lorentz Transformations. The interferometer
          contraction leads to a modified angle for the beam splitter, whose
          normal angle is 45° when the apparatus is stationary. Surprisingly,
          the new angle works fine and <b><i>apparently</i></b>, all seems to
          happen as though the interferometer was still at rest. Judge by
          yourself.</font></p>

          outgoing waves are reflected on a parabola in order to obtain
          transverse plane waves. They are tilted to a theta = arc sin (v/c)
          angle. Thus, they are traveling slightly frontward in such a way that
          the interferometer constantly follows them. Then the beam splitter
          produces two separate and orthogonal beams which are reflected back by
          the plane mirrors. The mirror on the right is nearer to the beam
          splitter than the upper one because of the contraction, and the beam
          reunification indicates that Lorentz's hypothesis (Larmor and
          FitzGerald also proposed it)&nbsp;was correct.</font></span></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><span lang="FR" style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">These
          images are also showing a very interesting optical effect: the beams
          are finally reunified by the beam splitter. Almost no light returns to
          the emitter. This occurs because the beam splitter does not really
          &quot;reflect&quot; the light beam. Matter on the transparent layer
          emits wavelets instead, whose phase is opposite. These wavelets cancel
          one half of the wave energy passing through it but their addition on a
          90° angle produces a new wave front whose phase is lambda/4 shifted.
          This phenomenon is a confirmation that the light waves cannot be
          stopped by matter. Surprisingly, the shade behind matter is caused by
          wavelets whose phase is opposite. This is not really a surprise
          because radio waves, X-rays and gamma rays are <b><i>not</i></b>
          stopped by matter. Let's face it, most of the spectrum obeys this rule
          and the light is the exception. In addition, a metallic screen or wire
          (especially a parasite antenna) are well known to capture some of the
          energy and then emit such wavelets whose phase is opposite. According
          to their number and their distribution, they also produce a shade
          exhibiting a characteristic diffraction pattern. However, in this
          case, the beam splitter very thin reflecting layer is insufficient to
          cancel the whole energy passing through it.</font></span></p>

          results.</font></b></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">By
          comparison, Special Relativity now appears frankly unreasonable. Those
          results are actually devastating for supporters of Einstein's Special
          Relativity. They were comfortably installed in their unexplainable
          certitude but those new facts (and more to come) are definitely
          waiting for new explanations.</font></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Up
          to now, nobody seems to have clearly described this remarkable
          behavior. The good idea should be to <b><i>reasonably explain</i></b>
          the resulting appearance of Relativity without Einstein's absurdities.
          As a matter of fact, Lorentzian Relativity is still to be elaborated.
          Lorentz was definitely on the right track but he never went beyond a
          mere explanation of Bradley's and Michelson's unexpected results and,
          perhaps, a better description of the transformed particles. What's
          worse, Henri Poincaré and Einstein ruled out matter contraction and
          (almost) the aether itself. Fortunately, they were all quite sure that
          faster then light speeds were impossible.&nbsp;This is not what some
          supporters of Lorentz's Relativity wrongfully think.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Bradley's
          aberration of light.</font></b></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">I
          also tested successfully the Bradley aberration of light in a
          moving frame of reference. Then the emitted light waves are undergoing
          the Doppler effect. Once again, the results are perfectly compatible
          with the existence of the aether. The hard to detect aether wind was
          the main problem well before Michelson. Sir Airy, the famous
          astronomer, was strangely clinging to Fresnel's idea that the wind
          speed should be proportional to the refraction index for glass or
          water. His experience using a telescope filled up with water was still
          a failure. All those phenomena including Michelson's experiment and
          Bradley's aberration of light seemed totally unexplainable.</font></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Considering
          the complexity of those phenomena and the lack of tools to check them,
          the 1900's mess is quite understandable. But I finally obtained
          flawless proofs that a moving observer always sees his environment as
          though he were perfectly stationary. Thanks to the virtual medium and
          my <a href="sa_scanner.htm">Time Scanner</a>, I can easily demonstrate
          that <b><i>apparently</i></b>, all optical phenomena don't change in
          spite of the Doppler effect, through a now fully acceptable aether.</font></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">And
          once again, it is on condition that the emitter frequency really slows
          down and that Lorentz's contraction (especially that of an optical
          device such as a parabola) takes place only along the direction of
          motion. Those clips are especially revealing. They clearly show how
          curved waves undergoing the Doppler effect are reflected on a
          parabola. They are transformed into plane waves, but they become
          tilted to the theta angle = arc sin (v/c). Then they are reflected on
          a plane mirror in such a way that the interference pattern follows the
          phase wave, whose speed is 1/beta. All along this phase wave,
          Lorentz's&nbsp; t'&nbsp; &quot;local time&quot; does not change.
          Finally, the waves return to the parabola, which focuses them into a
          classical Airy Disk, albeit it is contracted and submitted to the same
          local time according to the phase wave. It turns out that Lorentz was
          right. It is a fact. It is undisputable...</font></p>

          frequency must slow down in order to cancel the transverse wavelength
          contraction along orthogonal axes y and z. Below, my goal was to show
          how parallax is still possible in the presence of motion, in spite of
          the Doppler effect. As a matter of fact, parallax was Bradley's
          original idea. Opticians know very well that off-axis images obtained
          by means of a parabolic mirror suffer from coma and astigmatism. They
          also suffer from spherical aberration if the object distance is
          finite. In spite of this, parallax detection is still possible. And
          once again, the parabola must contract to do this accurately. This
          even includes the distance between two of them!</font></p>

          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">We
          need a practical theory in order to obtain more correct results. We
          especially have to deal with GPS satellites whose results could be
          even more accurate. Because the Doppler effect is definitely involved,
          the Lorentz Transformations cannot be neglected any more.&nbsp;The
          Doppler effect is present, it is easily measurable, and according to
          those new results the parabola must contract in order to reflect
          microwaves correctly.&nbsp; Here, speaking about space and time
          transformation is totally useless. It is rather a matter of true
          contraction and slower clocks. After all, only <b><i>our measures</i></b>
          on Earth are to be preferred; in this particular case we do not have
          to bother about local space and time. The satellite clocks must
          definitely indicate Standard Time, not their own slower time. One
          should avoid synchronizing them using radio signals transmitted from
          one to another because we know that this procedure ends up with a time
          shift. It is not a matter of Relativity, it is just a mechanical
          problem which can easily be solved thanks to the Lorentz
          transformations.</font></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;Surely,
          our Earth is not perfectly stationary with respect to the aether.
          However, one must firstly examine how those phenomena should occur if
          it was the case. The observer orbiting in a satellite is fully aware
          of his abnormal situation. Because he knows that his speed simply
          cannot be zero, he must admit that his emitter is sending waves which
          are undergoing the Doppler effect. He also knows that this effect is
          easily detectable on Earth, which is postulated to be stationary. And
          so, because is is still unable to detect the Doppler effect, <b><i>his

          Large arrays of computers working in parallel and even supercomputers
          are available. Thus, one can experiment those effects in a fast,

          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&quot;This
          strange property would truly seem a &quot;helpful hand&quot; from
          Nature to hide from our eyes the absolute motion of the Earth in spite
          of optical phenomena. This cannot satisfy me...&quot;</font></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Well,
          he was wrong. This &quot;strange property&quot; seems indeed a miracle
          (not to say a conspiracy considering the additional time shift and,
          thirdly, those slower clocks). It seemed so unlikely that this could
          occur that Lorentz finally abandoned his original hypothesis, which
          was still the only reasonable one.</font></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">But
          today, thanks to this new virtual medium, and also to my <a href="sa_scanner.htm">Time
          Scanner</a>, it becomes obvious that the orbiting observer is unable
          to detect his motion. Firstly, the phase wave cancels the Doppler
          effect. And later, the same phase wave cancels the time shift.
          Surprisingly, both focal planes appear simultaneous and perfectly
          symmetrical during a given t' time. This happens because waves
          traveling backward are faster, so that the information only appears
          simultaneous. In addition, because he himself is contracted, the
          observer cannot detect the remaining contraction either.</font></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Now,

          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Seeing
          this, one must admit that the relative speed of light is slower
          forward than backward. The difference seems to cancel the Doppler
          effect, but there is still a Doppler effect. From this point of view,
          the Earth being the preferred frame of reference, the speed difference
          only, not the absolute speed, should be considered. It becomes clear
          that optical phenomena and even mechanical phenomena still appear
          identical in the satellite environment. Even length contraction is
          unnoticeable because the observer is also contracted.</font> <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">This
          is why the observer orbiting in the satellite is fooled. <b><i>We
          found the cause.</i></b></font></p>
          <p align="left"><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Now, let's
          examine the Bradley aberration of light.</font></b></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Bradley's
          goal was to measure the distance to the nearest stars by detecting a
          parallax effect. The Earth's orbit proved to be a bit too small to do
          this, but Bradley unexpectedly discovered a different phenomenon.
          Because the speed of the Earth around the Sun is about 29 km/s, the
          telescope motion produces a small but measurable focus offset. Bradley
          soon realized that this effect was a consequence of the speed of
          light.</font></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Our
          virtual medium can easily show this. It is quite impossible to set the
          emitter (which represents a star) several light years away, but a
          large parabola produces the equivalent plane waves. Then let's add two
          small parabolas (Bradley's telescope) moving in opposite directions
          the way they would do around the Sun at 6-month intervals. In this
          first experience, the Sun is postulated to be perfectly stationary and
          the telescope speed is exaggerated to 1/3 of the speed of light in
          order to obtain a more dramatic effect.</font></p>

          surprise here: the Airy disk pattern reaches the point where the
          parabola optical axis was previously. </span>This result is quite
          simple and understandable. It was a good idea to firstly show what is
          normally going on, though, because the two parabolas and the wave
          patterns no longer remain symmetric if the Sun is moving. Today, we
          know very well that the Sun is orbiting around the galaxy center even
          faster then the Earth does around the Sun.</font></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The
          point is: Bradley did obtain a perfect symmetry. Such a result seemed
          to indicate that the sun is perfectly stationary with respect to the
          aether. </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Surely, the sun
          motion should rather introduce a severe asymmetry. Here, let's suppose
          that the Sun is moving at about one half of the speed of light. When
          both the Sun and the Earth are moving in the same direction, the speed
          of the Earth is accelerated to .5 + .33 = .83 c. Otherwise, it is
          rather slowed down to .5 - .33 = .23 c. So the Earth and the parabolas
          must periodically contract in accordance with Lorentz's shrinking
          factor. However, in order to reproduce the same 1/3 c velocity as
          above, as seen by the moving observer, one must refer to Poincare's
          law of speed addition, which is given by:</font></p>
          <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">beta''
          = (beta + beta') / (1 + beta * beta')</span></font></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">It
          turns out that the slowest and fastest composite speed should be .2
          and .7143 c. Then the contraction difference is severe: 98% vs. 70%.
          Obtaining a symmetric result using those differently contracted
          parabolas now appears unlikely to be possible, especially in the
          presence of the additional Doppler effect. Poincare's 1901 theory
          (&quot;optical phenomena are relative&quot;) was attractive because it
          was much simpler and apparently correct. I am quite sure that Lorentz
          did figure out such a scenario because Bradley and Michelson had
          severely damaged Newton's system. He had to abandon his hypothesis,
          for he was a great scientist. <b><i>It simply could not work.</i></b></font></p>

          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">This
          leads to Lorentz's Relativity. Consequently, Special Relativity is
          deadly wounded. Einstein's version (actually that of Poincare) was
          indeed attractive because it yielded correct predictions. No doubt, it
          was valuable, but now we need to know why all this is possible. We
          need to know how matter works. The basic principle is that any moving
          system still mechanically works perfectly on condition that those
          strange effects take place. Because of them, the moving observer
          cannot be aware of his motion any more. He still see things in his

          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">So
          it was important to elaborate the correct equation set&nbsp; for this,
          as Lorentz's purpose was rather to cancel the Doppler effect on
          Maxwell's equations in a moving frame of reference. <b><i>Surprisingly,
          Lorentz's x' and t' variables applied to the stationary system</i></b>.
          This is weird. Knowing this, I just swapped them and easily obtained

          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Let's
          make things perfectly clear: Lorentzian Relativity simply cannot be
          explained without those equations. They <b><i>must</i></b> be adopted
          by any scientist who is interested in Lorentz's works, even though
          Lorentz neglected to put them down this way.&nbsp;Secondly, I
          demonstrated a long time ago that those equations also produce <a href="sa_Doppler.htm">Lorentz's
          slower Doppler effect</a>. In this case, x variables stand for axial
          distances in wavelengths and t variables stand for the wave period,
          hence in 2*pi units. And thirdly, this is highly consistent with my <a href="sa_scanner.htm">Time
          Scanner</a>. Three independent and spectacular confirmations of the
          same facts cannot be a coincidence. The Lorentz Transformations are
          definitely a law of nature, and they are all about matter mechanics.
          Clearly, they will lead us well beyond Relativity.</font></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Fortunately,
          in this form, Lorentz's equations become quite easy to understand. One
          must bear in mind that all x and x' variables stand for absolute
          distances in light seconds, so that c = 1. On the contrary, while only
          t variables stand for absolute seconds, Lorentz carefully explained
          that t' variables do not indicate the &quot;true time&quot;. They only
          indicate slower seconds that clocks in this moving frame of reference
          should display. Suppose that velocity is 50% of the speed of light,
          hence beta = 0.5 and Lorentz's contraction factor is: g = 0.866. And
          finally, x = 1 and a one second delay (t = 1) occurred.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">1. g * x&nbsp;
          means that matter and distances contract to 86.6% of their original
          length along the direction of motion in accordance with Lorentz's
          contraction factor.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">2. beta * t&nbsp;
          means that matter simply moves to x' = 0.5 * 1 = 0.5 light second
          after a one second delay according to its speed. This is Galileo's
          Relativity Principle. However, because the coordinate was shifted to
          x'=0.866 after the contraction occurred, the final x' position is
          0.866+0.5= 1.366 light second.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">3. g * t means
          that moving clocks tick 86.6% slower, once again according to
          Lorentz's contraction factor. More exactly, the electron frequency and
          that of any cyclic mechanical process slows down. This is why the
          transverse wavelength, hence transverse distances, remains constant
          according to Lorentz's y'=y; z'=z.&nbsp;</font></p>

          compared to another clock whose original position was x = 0 (but whose

          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">This
          time shift is important because, in this frame of reference, the

          than forward (1<span lang="FR-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:

          consequence, and additionally because the contraction is unnoticeable
          as well, the clock synchronization procedure using light or radio
          signals perfectly matches this anomaly. It should be emphasized that
          this is not only a mere time shift. Cause and effect relationships are
          undergoing the same Doppler distortion, simply because causes are
          transmitted by waves. Thus, speaking about space and time
          transformation is meaningless and useless. One should rather consider
          that this appearance of simultaneity leads to an amazing but
          understandable mystification: the moving observer cannot detect his
          true speed through the aether any more.</font></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">This
          time shift can also be cross-checked by means of the phase wave, where
          Lorentz's t' time remains the same. It is where transverse waves
          incoming from opposite directions meet, given the fact that they
          are tilted to an angle which is given by: arc sin (v/c). The result is
          a scissor effect. Because of this constant but &quot;moving&quot; t'
          time, two observers A and B placed on the displacement axis will think
          that the wave front crosses this axis at the same time. So it will
          seem parallel to it, not tilted. I invented my <a href="sa_scanner.htm">Time

                  basic principles were simple, and obviously because its
                  predictions were correct. Unfortunately, it must be rejected
                  because it is unreasonable and misleading. It is a severe
                  obstacle to understanding things. In physics, even a correct
                  prediction is unsatisfactory. The ultimate goal is to <b><i>explain</i></b>
                  things.</font></td>

          site is very popular and it becomes more and more discussed. Thanks to
          my efforts, things are about to change. A lot of new sites whose
          subject is &quot;Lorentzian Relativity&quot; (check <a href="http://www.google.fr/search?hl=fr&amp;q=%22Lorentzian+Relativity%22&amp;btnG=Recherche+Google&amp;meta=lr%3D&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=">Google</a>)
          are available. This is quite a revolution. Thus, if one still prefers
          to rely on Einstein's weird principles and paradoxes, making all those
          new results still compatible with his version of the theory will soon
          become unsustainable.</font></p>

          true), but his interpretation of what is really going on is not.</font></td>
