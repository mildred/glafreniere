        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Prior to the Lorentz transformations, Michelson
        discovered a mechanical property of waves when they are observed in
        a moving frame of reference. This could be called the Michelson
        transformations but it is more simply the regular Doppler effect. A
        wavelength contraction according to g occurs on both transverse y and z axes, but

        to our example, planes flying inside such an x, y and z contracted space would
        always perform the round trip in two hours whatever the
        speed of the wind or its direction. This explains why no abnormal time effect occurs.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">So
        the main difference here is the time effect because both points of view

        too, x is the coordinate in the moving frame of reference. Thus:&nbsp; x
        = x' + beta * t.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">This
        was Galileo's point of view. However, according to Descartes, the x position
        should definitely refer to the Cartesian frame
        of reference, which is postulated to be at rest. After a given t time, because the rightward motion is a well
        admitted convention, this procedure creates an artificial secondary
        moving frame of reference. As a matter of fact, according to Descartes, the light propagates by means of the
        aether, which is postulated to be at rest. So the aether is not only a preferred
        frame of reference, it is the only admissible Cartesian frame of
        reference. This should lead to this inversion:&nbsp; x' = x + beta * t.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">But
        let us be honest: inside the moving frame of reference, the light
        traveling forward clearly propagates slower and the Doppler effect
        should be considered. The equation works for moving objects to a first
        approximation, but what if matter is made of waves?&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">One
        should bear in mind that Galileo's
        transformation is wrong because matter actually transforms according to
        the Lorentz transformations. Matter especially cannot reach the speed of
        light for this reason.</p>
        <p align="left"><b>A race between two waves.</b></p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Michelson
        noticed that the relative speed of light on a go and return trip is slower in the direction
        of motion. He realized that two orthogonal light beams could not produce the same interference fringes after a 90° rotation. He deduced from this that an interferometer could detect the
        speed of the aether wind.</p>

        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Finally,

        goal was to measure the fringes displacement after a 90° rotation. Such
        a rotation could be performed easily without any stress because the instrument was mounted

        from Nature in order to hide the way optical phenomena really work. He
        very severely rejects this hypothesis without any valid reason. He says
        that Lorentz's theory is near to be correct, but that it still needs
        some adjustments. He finally proposes that optical phenomena should only
        depend on the relative motion of sources, apparatus, etc.<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Let

        matter exhibits wave properties and that waves undergo the Lorentz
        transformations. So the contraction is not a &quot;helpful hand&quot;
        any more. It is rather an additional proof that Lorentz was right.</font>&nbsp;<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">It
        should be emphasized that Albert Einstein could read French and that he
        surely read this book. In all cases, his 1905 first edition about
        Relativity was nothing but a &quot;copy and paste&quot; of Poincaré's
        ideas. It is easily verifiable, and it is a shame that it is still
        ignored today. Personally, I think that this is rather funny because
        they were both wrong. So, who cares?&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Michelson
        and Lorentz strongly believed that aether should exist. So this page certainly matches
        their thoughts.</font>
        
        <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">
        
        However,
        this is not what scientists believe today, because they wrongly ruled out
        the aether.<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">So
        this page does not submit to standard opinion, albeit it is consistent
        with Lorentz's 1904 book. The science world
        is rapidly evolving today because of the Internet. People familiar with Lorentz's researches generally
        admit a privileged
        frame of reference, which in most cases coincides with aether. Some of
        them prefer the word &quot;space&quot;, but this is obviously a
        compromise because aether is a suspicious subject nowadays.<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Only
        people well aware of Lorentz's ideas can speak about Relativity, because
        it is the result of the Lorentz transformations. Others should be less affirmative because they ignore how Relativity
        was discovered.
        <p align="left"><b> Lorentz's was right.</b></p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Most
        web pages on the Michelson interferometer explain that the null
        result showed that aether does not exist. This is totally false.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Lorentz
        explained that the interferometer undergoes a contraction in the
        direction of motion. The first of Lorentz's three transformations is a length
        contraction, which occurs only on the x axis.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">For example,
        let us suppose a very high speed:&nbsp; 86.6% of the speed of
        light. Then beta = .866 and Lorentz's contraction factor is .5. The gamma
        factor equals the
        reciprocal: 1 / g = 2.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"> The following animated diagram shows that the
        round-trip duration along any of the 4 possible paths inside the
        interferometer's arms would be the same. This device can be seen as a <b><i>4
        branch interferometer</i></b>. Here, the very high speed involves a severe
        contraction to half of the original length, and the speed
        difference becomes clearly visible:</font></center>

        the same reason, any observer placed in the system's center O and using
        a radar signal would find by timing the echoes that all A, B, C and D distances are the same.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">However,
        he would not notice that the four radar echoes are two times longer because his
        clock also runs two times slower according to the gamma factor.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Because
        all forces are transmitted by means of waves, which undergo the Doppler
        effect, all matter mechanisms are also slowed down in the same way. All
        happens with a slower rate of time. Most often, one speaks about <b><i>time dilation</i></b>.
        This is incorrect. Time is a concept, an idea; it does not
        really exist. But a clock does exist, and it can tick slower. This does
        not mean that time runs slower.&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Secondly, waves
        (or planes) would reach the A point in the rear much more rapidly.
        Because of the Doppler effect, the B point will be attained later. Henri
        Poincare showed how, inside such a system, the central O observer must
        use light or radio signals in order to synchronize A and B clocks.
        Because the signal speed is much faster backward, A will be in
        advance and B will be late. However, nobody would be able to notice
        the resulting time shift. Inside such a moving frame of reference,
        Poincare showed that such <b><i>local hours</i></b> lead to a sort of
        virtual simultaneity. One cannot detect his actual speed any more. All happens as if the system was perfectly at rest inside aether.</p>

        matter's mass/energy is doubled for .866 c and this was also discovered
        by Lorentz. As a matter of fact, this phenomenon could be regarded as

        years were needed to solve this mystery. It was obvious,
        though, because Lorentz's equations are almost a copy of the Woldemar
        Voigt's ones on the Doppler effect (1887). Actually, the only difference
        was an unknown constant whose k = 1 value was finally discovered by Lorentz
        and Poincaré in 1904. It is that simple: matter behaves like waves.</p>
        <p align="left"><b>Standing wave contraction.</b></p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Very
        few people noticed that because light waves are reflected back on the
        interferometer's mirrors, standing waves appear inside both of its branches.
        Moreover, in 1904, standing waves compression was not a well known phenomenon. As
        far as I know it has been discovered by <a href="http://www.keelynet.com/spider/b-104e.htm">Mr.
        Yuri Ivanov</a>, and only me and <a href="http://ondes-relativite.info/">Mr.

        in the animation, I managed to add some reference marks along both branches in order to
        locate the nodes' position. It should be pointed out that such nodes are
        still present in the direction of motion, notwithstanding the fact that
        the wavelength is two times longer while the waves are traveling
        backward. This is possible because those waves also seem to travel two
        times faster. One needs a little concentration to observe this, but it
        finally becomes obvious.</span><p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="FR-CA">The mean relative velocity of light in order to perform a
        complete round-trip can be calculated as shown above. Let's repeat that waves behave in
        exactly the same manner as planes in the presence of wind. So the compression
        rate is also given by g and g squared:</span><p align="center">Relative

        a 90° phi angle, one can easily note that transverse waves

        relative transverse wave velocity is slowed down according to g, the time needed
        to perform the transverse go and return trip is also longer according to 1/g. The
        calculus for the on-axis whole round trip is a bit more complicated
        because the go and return trips are different, but one
        can use the simpler </span>1 <span lang="FR-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:

        the standing wave compression ratio equals the change in the relative velocity of

        Both calculi yield the same results. Michelson preferred velocity and did not use
        the standing wave method, which is simpler though, especially for studying the
        Kennedy-Thorndyke experiment. Actually, Kennedy and Thorndyke did not
        take the frequency reduction into account. The overall increased
        wavelength cancels the transverse contraction and reduces the on-axis
        contraction to g. So they were wrong.</span></font></center>

        that he is at rest because he sees the observer at rest undergoing the Lorentz
        transformations. Finally,
        nobody can tell for sure who is really moving.<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">So
        the main difference is that <b><i> the one at rest only is right.</i></b><p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Einstein
        postulates that they are both right. His Special Relativity
        cannot explain the difference between appearances and reality. So it is
        false.<p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Lorentz's
        Relativity can predict the same phenomena and it can also explain them.
        This is an important improvement. Starting from now, scientists can mechanically explain matter and all physical phenomena.
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">The
        aether thus should be
        rehabilitated. It was banished wrongfully, and it proves to be essential.</p>
        <p align="left"><b>Matter transforms the way Lorentz explained.</b></p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">This
        web site explains matter and all physical phenomena from a mechanical
        point of view. Our world is made of waves. It is no longer a theory which will be confirmed some
        day, it is a
        verifiable fact.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">In
        any event, there is at the present time only one logical explanation:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p align="left">The Michelson interferometer really undergoes a contraction.</li>
          <li>
            <p align="left">This occurs because matter is made out of standing
            waves.</li>
          <li>
            <p align="left">The aether is essential in order to explain them and
            also forces such as light, gravity, magnetism, etc.</li>
          <li>
            <p align="left">This explains Relativity.</li>
