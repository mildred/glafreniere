        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Nowadays
        most scientists are quite sure that the aether does not exist.
        Surprisingly, none of them did check this carefully. They just learned
        it from their professor.
        
        </p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The
        point is: you are not entitled to think that the aether is useless. You
        simply cannot prove it. If you think
        so, you sure are unaware of the standing waves amazing properties. And you
        did not carefully study Lorentz's version of Relativity, which finally
        proves to be true.
        
        </p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">This
        web site postulates that matter is made of &quot;moving standing waves&quot; and that all forces are
        waves. Those waves need an aether. In addition, Relativity was discovered by Lorentz and
        Poincaré in 1904. Not by Albert Einstein. Their original version, especially Lorentz's one, admits the existence
        of the aether. Lorentz never discarded the existence of the aether until his death
        in 1928.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Unfortunately, Lorentz
        was unaware (until
        he was very old, in 1927) of de Broglie's
        &quot;matter waves&quot;. This would have helped him around 1895 in
        order to explain the cause of his transformation. Standing waves actually undergo the Lorentz transformation. It is
        that simple. Any average intelligent person should firstly doubt about
        Einstein's ridiculous ideas. Physics should be an exact science. Not a
        religion.
        
        </p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">So,
        let's postulate that matter is made of waves and that those waves need
        the aether. Assuming this, you may imagine any hypothesis about
        its origin. In accordance with the Causality Principle, any effect has a
        cause. And because our material universe is purely made out of aether,
        this cause cannot be a material cause any more. So it should be un-material.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">You
        may explain the World's origin the way you prefer. You may also give

        quark is simply made of two electrons (or two positrons) very close
        together. However, especially on the axis joining them, their standing
        waves are adding themselves in a very special way. One obtains a set of
        plane standing waves which phase is different in the centre, canceling
        the normal electron negative charge. This produces a very strong
        &quot;gluonic field&quot; which can attract any other particle, and
        which mass is much greater then that of one electron. This electron pair
        with its gluonic field then looks very much like a totally different
        particle.

        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">In the

        was no specific electrons or positrons. As soon as
        a reasonable number of particles were present inside
        aether, those which phase was opposite were certainly attracted together and
        they collided. We
        know that such a collision produces quarks, but most scientists think
        that the electron and the positron annihilate. Actually, it is much more
        logic to suppose that those two particles are still existing inside the
        quarks, but that the strong gluonic field is hiding them.
        
        </p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Quarks are
        highly unstable. However two electrons and two positrons can join
        together and form a two-quarks meson, which is much more sable. Then
        another quark can join and produce a neutron.

        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">There could
        be another process. We know that a collision between an electrons and a
        positron produces two quarks, which are not identical. This could be
        explained by another way of producing electrons.
        
        </p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Most
        likely, one electron and one positron traveling towards each other will
        not truly hit themselves. Their wavelength is so small that their
        central core cannot coincide. They will rather follow a rotating
        elliptic trajectory much similar to that of binary pulsars. This is
        called &quot;positronium&quot;, also a highly unstable particle.
        However, as soon as those electrons and positrons come very close
        together the first time, they must change their direction in a very
        severe manner, the way a comet do while circumventing the Sun.

        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">This severe
        u-turn supposes that the standing waves near the core inside those
        particles will be transformed. The farthest ones will not, and so they
        will simply focus where the particles were supposed to be before
        colliding. The electron core is very small, but actually its standing
        waves fill a huge volume much larger then that of an atom.

        contain three or four electrons or positrons, and the system phase could
        be different from that of normal electrons or positrons.

        electrons at the vertices of a tetrahedron, or of a plane square. Here,
        there are six gluonic fields, which mass should be important. Then a
        third quark or a second meson could transform them into a neutron. Three
        quarks could also produce a neutron in just one step, but this situation

        Charles Darwin was right. For instance, one can follow the horse's

        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"> On the other hand Darwin only spoke about the

        </p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">I am
        pretending that the Evolution Theory should also include matter, because
        the whole universe evolved as well since its very beginning. About 15
        billions years, and probably more. Our
        knowledge also evolved, and Darwin was unaware of this.&nbsp;
        
        </p>
        <p align="left"><b>Natural selection does not fully explain evolution.</b></p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
        Darwin was also unaware of the DNA, chromosomes and genes mechanism. Nowadays
        it is a well known fact that general unchanged DNA very slowly leads to fully static and
        uniform species for a given environment.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
        So natural selection does not fully explain evolution. The main cause is
        accidental and occasional mutations inside DNA. Evolution is controlled
        by chance, if chance does exist. Darwin emphasized natural selection,
        which now appears to be just one aspect of the mechanism.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">This
        is important because chance also controlled the evolution of the whole
        universe since its very beginning.</p>

        And if the chance does not exist, your freedom is pure illusion.  In this case, the day of tomorrow already exists in the energy of an infinity of waves, and in the
        motion of an infinity of electrons.  Then you can do nothing
        about it: tomorrow will occur, unrelentingly.</p>
        
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

        <p align="center"><b>LET'S&nbsp; THINK</b></p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
        According to Darwin, we are mammal primates hominids, in other words,
        just animals. Our most recent discoveries about our ancestors, up to six
        millions of years, indicate that mankind, gorillas and chimpanzees have common ancestors.
        Darwin did predict that. They lived about 15 millions
        of years ago.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Those
        discoveries also indicate that about 10 millions of years ago, our
        definitely human ancestors were already biped. They had a small
        brain, not bigger than that of chimpanzees. However, they had already
        begun to perform this amazing phenomenon: <b><i>to think</i></b>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Knowing
        this, any human capable of thinking should conclude that just one man
        and one woman simply could not give birth to the whole mankind. Let's
        face it: Adam and Eve, from the Bible, never existed. During all those
        years, thousands of humans were simultaneously living in Africa. They evolved
        there much in
        the same way as all other animals, but they evolved faster and better.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Darwin
        was aware of that, but he did not dare to write it. So today one must
        affirm it clearly.</p>
        
        <p align="left"><b>We think with our brain.</b></p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Let's
        lastly say something that very few courageous people will admit: we are
        thinking with our brain. This is also a fairly recent discovery, for it
        occurred after Darwin's epoch.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">This
        means that at the very instant of our death, logically, we stop
        thinking.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">It
        is about time that one realizes this. Ancient Roman people used to
        explain that any dying person had to &quot;expire&quot; in order to let
        his soul escape from his body. They called this last breath « anima »,
        which simply means air, and the soul name soon followed as
        &quot;animus&quot;. However they were not aware that air was material.
        They simply noticed that the invisible and apparently un-material wind
        could cause a strange effect on their skin, and that this last air pulse
        could very well explain the also apparently un-material nature of their thoughts.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">I
        am not pretending that human beings have no soul. I simply note that those two
        apparently metaphysic reasons which have been invoked in order to
        explain the soul's existence have been clearly identified as being <b><i>physic</i></b>
        ones. So they belong to physics.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">If
        this does not satisfy your personal metaphysic thoughts, I cannot help.
        I just want to discuss physics. So please avoid annoying me about your
        emotional feelings and just discuss physics, because it is an exact
        science. Physics is the science of the truth.</p>
        
        <p align="left"><b>We are animals.</b></p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">We
        are nothing but animals. Fortunately we are animals who can think. This is a major advantage, but this still does not exclude us from the animal kingdom. Many readers
        wrote that they see themselves "on a higher level", but they can't explain why. Let's face it: we simply are animals.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
        This observation should switch us towards a better knowledge of our
        behaviour, for example by comparing it with that of gorillas and
        chimpanzees, our cousins.  Psychology is not an ideal:  it is a science.
        Our behaviour as a science follows the same rules as in physics. It
        should need observations and experiments, and it should avoid being
        distorted by our thirst for absolute.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"> One must
        firstly distinguish what we are from what we should be. Clearly, we
        cannot see the difference any more. Our behavior was imperatively inculcated to us under the terms of often debatable principles.  We
        cannot establish laws and habits which are compatible with our true
        nature any more.  With the result that too many of us are frustrated, badly adapted and unhappy.</p>
        
        <p align="left"><b>We are evolving backwards.</b></p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Darwin
        probably did not realize that natural selection is not working properly any more
        because we can and we do interfere. We do not accept its essential role.
        We can cure a lot of severe diseases which would have prevented many
        people to give birth to more people suffering from the same diseases. We
        do not inform those people that their health problems are likely to be transferred
        to their children. This leads to a deterioration of mankind's general
        health.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;Mankind
        is a fantastic achievement, proving that evolution normally works
        towards perfection. Our illogic behaviour will cancel this, though.
        Mankind is likely to degenerate and suffer for years, and finally
        disappear.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Let's
        make it clear: a conscious, advised and responsible selection is
        required. Otherwise we will simply terminate our trek. Nobody will ever
        be capable or repairing a human being inside all of his genes. No medicine, no
        genetic treatment can help.&nbsp;</p>

        there are too many of
        us, we will have to face new infectious diseases. More and more
        scientists are thinking that we may soon undergo major epidemics.</p>
        
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The damage that overpopulation already caused is enormous and
        irreversible. If we do not intervene radically right now, our chances to

        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Some
        day, because evolution normally works towards perfection, more animals
        and even plants will also be capable of thinking. Such events may happen
        in billions of years from now, or sooner, here or anywhere in the
        universe, but they will happen.</p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Students
        should avoid constantly repeating other's ideas. They should doubt about
        them, in accordance with Descartes' &quot;doubt is the origin of
        wisdom&quot;. Actually, all of the 6 billions people on this planet are
        very often wrong, and this leads to more errors, and finally to
        decadence. Many people also intentionally spread errors, for politic or
        financial reasons. Many people even lie to their own children, which is
        definitely the most despicable thing on Earth. Let's make it clear:
        unless he admits it, anybody who is in doubt does not say the truth, and
        so he lies.</p>

        A lot of schools, high schools and Universities in North America simply
        avoid speaking of Darwin in order to &quot;preserve&quot; their
        student's religion. Some of them are even pretending that Darwin was
        wrong. I myself had to suffer this shame. I had been recruited as a
        boarder student by a very special college among all of Quebec's seventh
        grade best scholars. I had to perform the IQ test (they used to
        eliminate all candidates below 140) and so I made the ancient

        spite of that, <b><i>I was not told about Darwin</i></b>, and, in

        that something was wrong. I decided to escape at the age of 19, but I
        nevertheless had to struggle all my life in order to repair my ideas. I
