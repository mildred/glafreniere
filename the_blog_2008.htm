          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Those
          images are likely to induce a revolution in advanced research
          facilities and universities because they will seriously challenge all
          physicists, especially in optics, radio electricity, astrophysics, and
          more exactly anybody who is concerned with Relativity. GPS measures
          will become more and more accurate in the future, and one will have to
          admit that a gigantic parabola on earth as seen from moving satellites
          should appear contracted like this, even if it is not. The same
          gigantic parabola as a satellite should also appear contracted just
          the same, as seen from here, but not as seen by astronauts in orbit.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">The goal is to explain reasonably <b><i>why</i></b> this occurs. Thus,
          volatile arguments such as space or time transformation will become
          very hard to deal with !</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Lorentz's
          predictions prove to be true. The corner reflector, the beam splitter
          and the parabola as well must contract in order to maintain the system
          aberration-free. I also demonstrated a long time ago that diffraction
          patterns such a Young's, Fresnel's, and even the Airy disk undergo a
          similar contraction. As a consequence, the moving observer becomes
          unable to deduce his velocity from it. Surely, opticians will be
          capable of releasing far more accurate and nice images soon; but mine
          are definitely relevant. They cannot be doubted any more. Lorentz's
          hypothesis was wrongly discarded. It becomes acceptable again and
          fortunately, it is simple:</p>

          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Let
          me repeat that Henri Poincare was obviously the origin of this mess.
          In 1901, well before Einstein's Special Relativity, which is
          surprisingly similar,&nbsp; Poincare wrote (Electricity and Optics):</p>
          <p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/Poincare_coup_de_pouce.gif"></p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">(Translation)
          <font color="#000080">&quot;Then one imagined an additional
          hypothesis. All material bodies should undergo a length contraction
          along the motion of the earth (<i>example according to 29 km/s, but
          the correct value should be 2x10^8</i>). This strange property would
          seem a true thumb snap (<i>a helpful hand</i>) from nature in order to
          avoid that the earth's absolute motion was revealed. This cannot
          satisfy me and I guess that I must say how I feel about it right now:
          I think that, most probably, optical phenomena are dependent on
          relative motion of involved material bodies, light sources or optical
          devices, and this, not in accordance with any given aberration
          (Lorentz's g^2 or g^3), but rigorously. Our experiences will become
          more and more accurate and this principle will then prove to hold
          true. Do we need a new thumb snap, a new hypothesis each time we get
          closer ? Surely not: a well made theory should allow one to rigorously
          demonstrate a principle in just one step. Lorentz's theory still does
          not make it. Among all those which were proposed, it is the nearest to
          make it. Consequently, we can hope that it will be made perfectly
          satisfying without severely modifying it.&quot;</font></p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">On
          the one hand, Poincare strongly rejects Lorentz's hypothesis about
          matter contraction without any solid argument. He only
          &quot;feels&quot; that it does not seem satisfying but he nevertheless
          writes quite arbitrarily that &quot;Lorentz's theory doesn't make
          it&quot;.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">On
          the other hand, once again without any solid argument, he writes that
          &quot;<font color="#000000">optical phenomena are dependent on
          relative motion of involved material bodies</font>&quot;. This
          relative point of view is the very basis of Relativity, and Lorentz
          pointed out that Poincare was the first man to use this word. As a
          matter of fact, optical phenomena just <b><i>seem</i></b> to be
          dependent on relative motion. The word &quot;seem&quot; makes all the
          difference and obviously, it is Poincare, not Lorentz, who firstly
          discovered Relativity. But it turns out that Lorentz's version is the
          correct one: in the future, Relativity should be called
          &quot;Lorentz's Relativity&quot;.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Any reasonable person should admit
          that Lorentz's Relativity still holds true. Fortunately, there are no complicated differential equations
          to handle. However, one must understand very
          well Lorentz's special Doppler effect involving a slower frequency in
          order to maintain a constant transverse wavelength.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">The
          error, for it is definitely an error, is that there is no true
          reciprocity. The interferometer at rest does not contract. The contraction occurs in accordance with its
          absolute velocity through the aether for mechanical reasons, because
          matter exhibits wave properties. Thus, matter is also submitted to the
          Doppler effect. It contracts the same way standing waves do. If the
          observer is at rest, his observations are correct. If he moves, he
          becomes unable to check his speed, but it only means that he is
          fooled. Both situations appear to be perfectly reciprocal but
          actually, they are not. Poincare's point of view is wrong because it
          does not take what is really going on into account.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">What
          is more, Poincare also wrote in 1902 (La
          science et l'hypothèse, <i>Science and Hypothesis</i>): &quot;Who
          cares if the aether really exists. This is a problem for metaphysicians. (...)
          Some day, the aether will probably be abandoned because it is
          unnecessary. Clearly, he was performing better in mathematics than in
          physics. It was indeed a very bad move to discard the aether
          hypothesis so rapidly, without firstly explaining how the light
          propagates. Maxwell did not explain the mechanical process, which is
          still unexplained. For now, the aether hypothesis remains a highly
          acceptable one.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">In
          addition, Poincare and Einstein discussed optical phenomena in a
          moving frame of reference without taking the Doppler effect into
          account. This is weird. All the problem lies there. Relativity is
          solely the consequence of the Doppler effect, and Christian Doppler
          himself had already noticed that an observer placed on a flat train
          wagon could not hear this phenomenon in his environment, for example a
          little orchestra. On the contrary, he records a Doppler effect if the
          sound comes from an unmoving device. From his point of view, this
          device seems to move, but the illusion is only partial because he can
          feel the wind; he can even detect a contraction in the sound waves.
          But in the case of light and radio waves, all his experiments in order
          to measure the &quot;aether wind&quot; will yield a null result.</p>

          The only remaining question to answer is:</font><p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">While
                  observing an unmoving device such as a parabola and its emitter, how come
                  the moving observer is fooled and thinks that it is undergoing
                  the Lorentz transformations?</font>

          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">One
          finds three reasons.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">1.
          The observer and his environment undergo a contraction.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">2.
          All physical phenomena occur with a slower rate of time.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">3.
          A time shift appears along the displacement axis.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">This
          is what Poincare called the &quot;Lorentz transformations&quot;. It
          should be emphasized that Lorentz borrowed his equations from
          Woldemar Voigt and that their primary purpose was to cancel the
          Doppler effect on Maxwell's equations. Lorentz finally removed a
          constant which appeared to be unnecessary because the correct Doppler
          effect involves a slower frequency (not a slower time!). It was the
          secret to obtain a constant wavelength along a transverse axis, hence
          no transverse contraction: y'=y; z'=z. So Lorentz was surely well
          aware that he was dealing with the Doppler effect.</p>

          demonstrations should mark the turning point of a totally new Physics.
          Now that they have become perfectly clear and undisputable, my goal is
          to send them all over the world and help interested scientists to
          obtain even more dramatic results. This may occur very fast because
          they will not have to reinvent the fundamentals, such as the optimized
          algorithm, damping/reflection management, Doppler effect, etc.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Now,
          any reasonable person should admit that Lorentz's hypotheses,
          especially matter contraction, clocks running slower, and &quot;local
          hours&quot; are highly relevant. Unfortunately, they were rapidly
          abandoned without any valid reason as soon as Einstein published his
          Special Theory of Relativity in 1905. The existence of the aether
          itself was also wrongly abandoned.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">As
          a matter of fact, Relativity is true, but the causes still need to be
          explained. Relativity should not be a dogmatic theory. One does not
          need to be a genius to understand it any more because we could collect
          a lot of information about matter since 1905. Especially, Lorentz,
          Poincare and Einstein were not aware of matter's wave properties. In
          addition, we have developed powerful tools.</p>
          <p align="left"><b>Matter contraction is an acceptable hypothesis.</b></p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Matter
          contraction cannot be rejected any more. It is the main reason why
          Relativity holds true. It becomes clear that Michelson's apparatus
          cannot reveal any variation whatever its speed or orientation. The
          observer becomes unable to estimate his velocity through an hypothetic
          but perfectly admissible wave medium. As a consequence, even the
          observer truly at rest with respect to this medium becomes unable to
          prove it either. The situation then appears fully reversible,
          reciprocal, indeed relative (Henri Poincare spoke about the
          &quot;Relativity Postulate&quot; in St-Louis, Missouri, USA, in 1904).
          The basic principle is amazingly simple: any observer is entitled to
          suppose that he is at rest; any other one whose speed or direction is
          different is considered to be moving.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">The
          important point is that only one of them is truly at rest. In such a

          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">It
          should be emphasized that Poincare and Einstein did not admit this.

          Waves propagating transversally with respect to the motion axis are
          tilted according to a theta angle = arc sin(v/c). This is a very
          useful data because sin(theta) indicates the normalized beta velocity
          and cos(theta) indicates the contraction factor suggested by Lorentz.
          This is no surprise. On the contrary, in spite of Lorentz's indication
          about &quot;local hours&quot;, nobody seems to understand that this
          time offset makes it impossible for a moving observer to detect this

          Poincare was wrong on this because he never admitted matter

          clocks. Actually, matter contraction will automatically correct the
          time offset, at least from their point of view. They will still think
          that they are at rest; they will then suppose that the aether doesn't

          The emitter's frequency must slow down according to Lorentz's
          contraction factor (the so-called &quot;time dilation&quot;) in order
          to obtain a constant wavelength transversally (Lorentz's y’=y,
          z’=z ). The authors of the Kennedy-Thorndyke experiment did not take
          this into account. They only tried to rule out matter contraction by
          means of a special interferometer whose arm length was unequal.
          Clearly, they did not understand well the Lorentz transformations.<o:p>
          This experience appears to be the worst ever because it wrongly lead
          to the abandon of the aether hypothesis. In fact, the aether becomes
          highly relevant again because matter itself exhibits wave properties.
          Surely, scientists will have to explain its mechanisms, on a <b><i>mechanical</i></b>
          basis. The light itself is still to be explained on the same basis,
          and thus people who rejected it (this evolution was subtle without any
          demonstration of it) were definitely bold, not to say irresponsible.</span></p>

          The moving version needs more images for tilted waves to reach the
          opposite side. This indicates that cyclic or repetitive events in the
          moving frame of reference occur with a slower rate of time. Those
          waves seem to move slower because their true direction is given by the
          theta angle (30° for a beta speed of .5). Because matter mechanics
          works by means of waves, all material events occur slower at high
          speed. For instance, if our galaxy was moving faster the Earth would
          take longer to execute a full rotation around the sun; clocks
          regulated in accordance with this motion would indicate slower hours.
          It is that simple. Why not just admit this instead of introducing an
          absurd and useless &quot;time dilation&quot;?</span></p>

          All of the interferometer elements (including the parabola, which
          transforms curved waves into plane waves) are undergoing a
          contraction. Then the beam splitter angle is not 45° any more. This
          general contraction of a moving frame of reference today appears to be
          a magnificent symphony to the glory of Lorentz. Even the
          Fresnel-Fraunhofer diffraction pattern obeys this law, once again
          making it impossible for the moving observer to deduce his velocity
          from it. The ultimate point is that standing waves also contract this
          way, on condition that the basic frequency slows down according to
          Lorentz's contraction factor. One must draw the conclusion that, if
          matter really contracts, the only valid explanation appears to be that
          this occurs because of its wave properties. This is a new fact.
          Lorentz, Poincare and Einstein were unaware of this. This easily
          explains their final but wrong interpretation, which needs to be
          reconsidered.</span></p>

          The &quot;squashed parabola&quot; moves at the same speed as the
          straight mirror located on the opposite side. This device reproduces
          Bradley's stellar aberration. What we observe is that it cannot reveal
          its absolute speed through the wave medium; it can reveal only the
          speed difference if there is one. This phenomenon was analyzed by
          Augustin Fresnel but he failed to explain correctly it because he was not aware

          I used the &quot;hard reflection&quot; option for those experiments, which is
          well known to produce a phase inversion on light waves and on
          radio waves as well. However, this experience indicates that it is no
          longer true for the beam splitter; I think that the results should be
          similar using genuine beam splitters or 45° oblique plane reflectors
          capable of reflecting only 50% of a wave beam. The animations shows
          that waves are undergoing a pi/2 phase shift (1/4 of a period in
          advance) when they reach the other side of the mirror on condition
          that the transmission ratio is 50%. This phenomenon sheds some new
          light on the fact that the beam is finally almost totally reunified
          when exiting the apparatus. The faint residual beam which returns to
          the source appears to be mainly a consequence of the
          Fresnel-Fraunhofer diffraction pattern, which also produces variable
          phase shifts especially along optical axes.</span></p>

          people are not well aware of Michelson's discovery about the
          surprising faster round trip on a transverse axis. Below is a simple,
          yet instructive demonstration. It shows that, on condition that the
          interferometer <b><i>does not contract</i></b>  (in actuality, it does!), a time
          difference appears between signals propagating axially and
          transversally on a go and return trip. This is a fundamental property of the Doppler effect;
          it was called &quot;the aberration&quot; by Lorentz and Poincare; I managed to make the third movie &quot;No
          Contraction&quot; in order to show what would occur in such a case. It
          turns out that the light beam
          direction would also frankly deviate off-axis because the beam-splitter angle is
          incorrect.&nbsp;I read somewhere that Lorentz was aware of this

          made of waves, could still knock at the
          door without going through it all the way. This is an interesting but still
          incomplete demonstration that waves are capable of interaction.&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">In
          the case of an ellipse, the distance to any point of the curve and
          then to the other focal point is constant. Thus,
          waves emitted from the first focal point should attain the second one
          without any phase offset. Apparently, this should produce perfectly
          circular standing waves.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">However,
          because one half of the energy is emitted towards a smaller portion of
          the ellipse, the amplitude difference makes it so that the second
          standing wave core becomes elliptic. Moreover, it moves rightward. The
          important point is that the ellipse forces the second focal
          point to stay immobile; but in the case of the electron it is rather a
          stand alone independent system. More waves incoming from any direction should
          modify the core and cause it to move. This strongly suggests that <b><i>radiation
          pressure</i></b> on matter waves is possible.
          This leads to the action and reaction law which is at the basis of
          Matter Mechanics.&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">We
          are working on models showing that this phenomenon should be
          surprisingly intense. Between two electrons, there is always a field
          of force made of standing waves whose amplification produces strong convergent
          waves towards both sides.
          As a matter of fact, standing waves alternately compress then depress
          the wave medium in such a way that waves traveling through them are faster, and
          then slower. This produces a lens effect and the energy is finally
          transmitted to both electrons.</p>

          program deserves careful attention. Now, one can observe waves
          undergoing hard or soft reflection on all kinds of reflectors. There
          are three display options for amplitude, energy, and also standing
          waves, thanks to Mr. Marcotte's new calculus using the Lagrangian. Reversing the wave direction (they return to their origin) or
          transform traveling waves into standing waves is possible. A special
          function was added in order to check the
          reflector gain, for example that of a corner reflector, which is
          surprisingly effective. One can also observe why a parabola produces
          straight waves, allowing them to stay inside a narrow energy beam.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Dealing
          with soft reflection on a curved reflector was quite a challenge. I
          really had to include soft reflection because it is most often the
          case for sound. So I hope that acousticians will love it.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">However,
          light and radio waves rather undergo a hard reflection with a pi or

          by inverting green and red color. Hard reflection is much simpler to deal
          with. Fortunately most of my demonstrations, for example the Michelson

          it should be pointed out that Mr. Marcotte's algorithm in one
          dimension, which is obviously the simpler and most efficient one, was
          invented in January 2006. I challenge anybody to find any consistent
          proof indicating that it existed in 2005 or before. It should be put
          down exactly in the following form and sequence:</p>
          <p align="center">past(x) = present(x)</p>
          <p align="center">present(x) = trend(x)</p>
          <p align="center">trend(x) = present(x<span lang="FR-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:

          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Please
          stop repeating that it existed well before unless you do have this
          proof. There should be a maximum of 8 variables without any additional
          procedure. I acknowledge that many algorithms existed before,
          especially Mr.
          Philippe Delmotte's one, which also yields perfect results.
          Unfortunately, Mr. <a href="http://www.falstad.com/mathphysics.html">Paul
          Falstad</a> does not know the name of the author of his method. I
          could check that all those algorithms contain additional variables or
          procedures, and sometimes the results are wrong or problematic.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">But
          secondly, Mr. Jocelyn Marcotte went further. During the same year
          2006, he elaborated a more complex but very efficient 2-D version
          using 4 additional neighbors on the diagonals, but with half of their
          influence only. This is an application of the normal square of the
          distance law. The diagonal neighbors being 1.414 times farther, their
          influence is indeed theoretically two times weaker.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">I
          would like to apologize here to Mr. Marcotte for not realizing during
          at least two years that his enhanced method is really great. While
          using only 4 neighbors, the energy transfer on the diagonals is
          reported to the next sequence. This produces more or less squarish
          waves, especially near the pulsating center and for very short
          wavelengths. I did myself try to use 8 neighbors, but this did not
          significantly accelerate the waves. Mr. Marcotte's magnificent idea
          was to take the central energy into account on a negative basis, as it
          had already been observed that the positive value could rather
          produces variable but slower speed, which is useful for simulating
          lenses.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Finally,
          in spite of its complexity, this optimized algorithm is still faster
          because the wave velocity is accelerated to 1 pixel per loop exactly
          instead of .707. What is more, this procedure is transposable in 3-D.
          Then it also yields a velocity of one pixel per loop, which is very
          comforting and convincing. In such a case, one must use the square root
          of 3 for the neighbors placed on the vertices of a cube. This leads to
          an even more complex but highly dependable calculus using three different
          levels of influence and 26 neighbors. During the same year 2006, Mr.
          Marcotte used this optimized algorithm in order to reproduce my 3-D
          Doppler moving electron. It was definitely a memorable World's
          Premiere.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt" align="left"><b>The c
          = 1 normalized speed.</b></p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">The
          interesting point for me is that this 1-pixel velocity is consistent
          with Henri Poincare's c = 1 normalized speed of light. This convention
          allowed him to elaborate a considerably simplified version of the
          Lorentz transformations. So we will use the simplified equation set
          without any additional correction, making our demonstrations much more
          convincing. Here is a copy from Poincare's 1901 (four years before
          Einstein!) book &quot;Electricity and Optics&quot; :</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt" align="center"><img border="0" src="images/Poincare_equations.gif" width="645" height="150"></p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Actually,
          this is a simplification of the Voigt Transformations (1887), where
          Voigt's constant &quot;l&quot; is useless. Lorentz found that it could
          be removed from the equation set because the null result for the
          Michelson interferometer is obtained only if&nbsp; l = 1.&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">I
          myself found that the normal Doppler effect occurs when l = g (This is
          Lorentz's g contraction factor, see below). If l = 1 according to
          Lorentz, the simpler equation set rather involves a <b><i>slower
          frequency</i></b>. I also found that one must swap x, x' and also the t, t'
          variables in order to produce this slower Doppler effect. Lorentz and
          Poincare preferred the inverted version in order to obtain a perfect
          invariance when applying them to Maxwell's equations. In practice,
          this simply will modify the x coordinates and the t period or phase
          (not the time!) of the Wave Generator in the program available above.
          More exactly, those equations simply describe the electron behavior at
          high speed. Thus, speaking of space contraction and time dilation
          appears <b><i>ridiculous</i></b>. This interpretation was certainly
          the most catastrophic error in Physics ever. No doubt, it originated
          from Poincare's reticence about matter contraction, which was
          Lorentz's bright idea at that time.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt" align="center"><img border="0" src="images/lorentz03f.gif" width="321" height="144"></p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt" align="center">The
          inverted Lorentz transformations produce a Doppler effect instead of
          correcting it.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt" align="center">The x
          and t symmetric equations on the right hand side were adapted from
          Poincare's version.&nbsp;</p>

          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"><b>I
          discovered a new improved damping screen.</b></p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">The
          wave algorithm simply transfers energy from one &quot;granule&quot; to
          its neighbors without any loss, with the inevitable consequence that
          the waves undergo a hard reflection when they reach the medium limits.
          Most often, the reflections must be eliminated and Mr. Philippe
          Delmotte succeeded as soon as 2005, thanks to a relatively wide
          damping zone (100 pixels or more). It is a tough and time consuming
          method, though.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Fortunately,
          I had to review the whole set of screens and mirrors because Mr.
          Marcotte's optimized algorithm works differently. I accidentally found
          an amplifier screen and a phase inverter. I also noticed that one must
          use progressively the soft reflection instead of the full damping
          procedure when the incidence angle becomes important. So I followed
          this Ariadne's thread and I finally elaborated last week a very simple
          damping screen which is successfully in use in the above-mentioned
          program.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">But
          unfortunately, this damping screen becomes more difficult to deal with
          when the incidence angle cannot be known for sure. This is especially
          the case when the source is moving, when there are many sources, or
          when other reflections occur. The situation near the reflection point
          surely can be analyzed, but the smaller error produces a faint
          reflection which complicates ulterior interventions and finally ends up
          with a disaster. I am confident that a simple and trouble-free all-azimuth
          damping screen is possible, but I am afraid that finding it requires a
          better I.Q. than mine.</p>

          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Below
          is my fourth program on the Wave Mechanics. This one explores the
          capabilities of Mr. Jocelyn Marcotte's wave algorithm, which was
          created in June 2006. We worked closely together and the final result
          appears quite remarkable. We can now very easily generate and handle
          all kinds of waves. We also elaborated more simple and efficient procedures.
          This invention has now reached a very high degree of perfection.</p>
          <p align="center"><a href="/programs/WaveMechanics04.bas">WaveMechanics04.bas</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          <a href="/programs/WaveMechanics04.exe">WaveMechanics04.exe</a></p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Please
          note that Mr. Marcotte does not necessarily agree with my own theories
          about the wave nature of matter. The important point is that this
          algorithm produces absolutely normal waves. No theory there. No
          fantasy. Just waves.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Thus,
          I am confident that people interested in waves, especially opticians
          and acousticians, will realize soon that MM. Philippe Delmotte and
          Jocelyn Marcotte invented something important. This new computerized
          virtual wave medium proves to be a powerful tool, a genuine
          laboratory. Scientists will obtain a much better comprehension of all
          wave phenomena. There is a huge difference between theory and practice
          because facts are not disputable. Although virtual facts may appear
          quite evanescent, this wave algorithm will on the contrary yield very
          reliable results. As a matter of fact, all wave phenomena can otherwise
          be experimented through material waves such as sound, and yield
          the same results. For instance, hundreds of loudspeakers connected to the
          same sinusoidal source and evenly distributed on a circular spherical surface
          will produce a genuine (but noisy) Airy disk. The Huygens Principle
          (Fresnel integrals) can also predict this but scientists will finally
          prefer the algorithm because it is much easier to handle.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Let's
          face it: physics deviated from its logical course one hundred years
          ago because this tool was absent. Look at this:</p>
          <p align="center"><a href="avi/Michelson_orthogonal_forward_51_angle.avi">Michelson_orthogonal_forward_51_angle.avi</a></p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">The
          virtual medium can easily reproduce what is really going on inside the
          Michelson interferometer. I simply applied the Lorentz
          transformations. In 1895, Lorentz was on the right track, but he
          finally gave up on matter contraction because all scientists
          (especially Poincaré and Einstein) rejected this idea.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">And
          this is only the tip of the iceberg. Thanks to this algorithm, I will
          slowly but surely produce more and more demonstrations. I admit that
          my hypotheses about the wave nature of matter definitely look weird,
          but they will prove to be correct and consistent with Lorentz's
          Relativity.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">From
          my point of view, here is what is really weird. Since one hundred
          years, thousands and thousands of scientists studied and spoke about
          motion and Relativity without ever taking the Doppler effect into
          account. So I strongly suggest that you firstly examine my <a href="sa_scanner.htm">Time
          Scanner</a> and compare the results to the <a href="sa_Lorentz.htm">Lorentz
          transformations</a> (as seen by Lorentz himself). No doubt, Relativity
          is all about the Doppler effect, is it not so complicated, and our new
          virtual medium can handle it magnificently.</p>
          <p align="left"><b>May 3, 2008.</b></p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">I
          am proud to release two new programs explaining the basics of the Wave
          Mechanics:</p>
          <p align="center"><a href="/programs/WaveMechanics02.bas">WaveMechanics02.bas</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">The
          goal was to perfectly reproduce all wave phenomena. I also managed to
          make the source code the simplest and the clearest possible. Some
          previous programs which were created two or three years ago in order
          to test Mr. Philippe Delmotte's algorithm were a bit more complicated.
          In addition, one could not always obtain perfect results while dealing
          with problems such as residual reflection. But now the programs work
          beautifully.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Opticians
          and acousticians should be highly concerned about the amazing
          capabilities of this virtual medium, which also works in a two or
          three dimensional space. In my opinion, a similar but more elaborated
          algorithm should be be capable of reproducing the free atomic electron
          behavior for very high frequencies. Clearly, such frequencies are not
          only caused by an electron flow. Free electrons are mainly moving to
          and fro on a very short distance. They all together become a genuine
          and independent wave medium, creating an electronic wave. I also
          predict that there is no true light propagation inside transparent
          material such as glass or optical fiber. In such a case, energy
          transmission is caused by similar electronic oscillations. However,
          because inner atomic electrons are involved, they can also oscillate
          in a circular motion in order to produce polarization rotation as well
          as axial.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">It
          should be emphasized that genuine waves are the result of a mechanical
          process. Delmotte's algorithm clearly shows that they definitely do
          not always behave the way mathematicians used to explain. For
          instance, any fractional step (such as one introduced by a given
          mechanism) produces quantum effects which become well visible for
          sawtooth or square waves. Such waves contain harmonics, hence shorter
          wavelengths which are progressively left behind because they propagate
          slower. Some energy is also converted into static vibrations, some
          sort of &quot;heat&quot;. We will also show that waves, especially
          standing waves, can act and react. Thus, matter being made of waves,
          it surely can act and react the way Newton discovered. A wave is not
          an equation, it is a physical phenomenon. Physicists should think
          mechanics. They should be aware that mathematics are just a tool, not
          a transcendental cause which rules the universe. It is a very bad idea
          to use mathematics when one simply ignores what is really going on.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Clearly,
          the Wave Mechanics explains matter mechanics. It is a well known fact
          that kinetic energy can be stored into fields of force as potential
          energy. Those are matter's most important properties. Standing waves
          indeed contain energy, and this strongly suggests that fields of force
          could be made of standing waves.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">This
          is undisputable: traveling waves do transport energy, and standing
          waves do contain energy. Physicists discovered not so recently that
          any intermediate situation also exists: partially standing waves, or
          standing waves which are actually moving at variable speeds because of
          the Doppler effect. Let's face it: matter can move, it thus can
          transport its own energy inside its standing waves, and this energy
          should be higher (Lorentz's mass increase) because of the wave
          compression as a result of the Doppler effect. This perfectly explains
          kinetic energy and Newton's mechanics, even for very high speeds where
          the Lorentz transformations must be taken into account. This is
          obvious because the Lorentz transformations are nothing else and
          nothing more than a Doppler effect. Finally, this also explains
          Relativity.&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">I
          am truly devastated that all the scientific community on this planet
          still adopt such a stubborn attitude. This avenue is brilliant, it is
          illuminated like a city's main boulevard. </font>   <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">
          Physicists also deceivingly reject this amazing tool invented by Mr.
          Philippe Delmotte. Yet we have here a perfect wave medium which should
          imitate quite well the aether, which surely exists because matter is
          made of waves. Actually, the aether may still exhibit unexpected
          properties, but the algorithm is flexible and can be modified in order
          to reproduce them.

          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Mr.
          Jocelyn Marcotte and Mr. Anselme Dewavrin discovered how to make Euler's method
          more accurate. Up to now, mathematicians warned that this method yields
          only approximate results.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">For
          example, one can obtain the sine for 45° this way:</p>
          <p align="left">1. Use a 360° scale in order to obtain integers.</p>
          <p align="left">2. The required step was once given by:</p>
          <p align="center">step = 2 * pi / 360</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">This
          step is inaccurate, though. Mr. Dewavrin found the correct one in
          October 2006, but his formula was too complicated.</p>
          <p align="left"><b>Correction on April 17, 2008</b></p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">A
          reader informed me today that he had found a simpler formula. He also
          pointed out that Euler himself was surely aware that his method could
          yield fairly good results. There is still a small uncertainty
          remaining for the same reason that one simply cannot draw a perfect
          sine curve using straight lines.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">The
          correct step (in radians) is given by:</p>
          <p align="center">step&nbsp; =&nbsp; 2 * sin(pi / 360)</p>
          <p align="left">3. Also in October 2006, Mr. Dewavrin discovered a
          simplified algorithm capable of listing the whole sine and cosine
          scale (hence sinusoidal oscillations) using two iterative program lines only:</p>
          <p align="center">sine = sine + cosine * step&nbsp;<br>
          cosine = cosine <span lang="FR-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-ansi-language:
FR-CA;mso-fareast-language:FR;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">–</span> sine * step</p>
          <p align="left">4. One should initialize the sine to 0 but <b><i>not</i></b>
          the cosine to 1 as it would seem logical. Mr. Jocelyn Marcotte
          discovered last week that the cosine needs a
          slight advance in order to cancel the retardation firstly introduced
          by the algorithm. The correct cosine initialization is given by:</p>
          <p align="center">cosine = Cos(step / 2)</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Then
          the sine scale becomes perfectly accurate up to 9 digits for double
          precision variables. The cosine scale is also perfectly accurate, yet
          all angles are 1 / 2 shifted as a result of cosine initialization
          offset.
          Below are two
          programs showing this:</p>

          <p align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify"> Nobody can state that Euler's
          method is inaccurate any more. It does firstly introduce a specific
          error, but this error is foreseeable and verifiable. So one may add
          the equivalent correction which will cancel it (well, almost). Here,
          one obtains a surprising accuracy up to 9 digits, which is fantastic.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Such
          achievements are important for us because oscillations are the very
          basis of waves' behavior. Each new element helps us to understand what
          is truly going on. We already created or improved algorithms
          reproducing virtual waves, but some of the effects are still to
          discover. Especially, genuine waves (not equations) are never
          perfectly sinusoidal,
          and this strongly suggests that they may not behave exactly the way
          equations indicated. It should be emphasized that Mr. Philippe
          Delmotte's and Jocelyn Marcotte's virtual wave algorithms use a
          similar step, so they are likely to produce the same unpredictable
          effects.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">It
          turns out that any granular medium (made of electrons, atoms or
          molecules, for example) clearly exhibit <b><i>quantum</i></b>
          properties. As explained above, energy transmission must be performed
          in a step-by-step process, and the step vs. wavelength ratio is not
          linear. A specific energy transmission <b><i>constant</i></b>
          should be considered. This means that ultrasonic waves
          behave differently for shorter wavelengths where very few
          molecules are involved.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Clearly,
          genuine waves do not behave exactly the way equations indicate. They
          truly exhibit unusual and surprising properties. Especially, waves can
          act and react with other waves, and such a behavior was surely not
          foreseeable using wave equations. Thus, being made of standing waves,
          two material bodies can <b><i>act and react</i></b> according to
          Newton's laws.</p>

          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">As
          a science, the Wave Mechanics is all about Matter Mechanics. Waves
          explain all: energy, forces, action and reaction, motion, inertia,
          etc. I wrote somewhere that today's invasion of physics by
          mathematicians is a plague. A wave is not an equation. It is a
          mechanical phenomenon which can be more or less predicted by an
          equation, which remains an approximation despite its perfection. The
          real thing is much better. In my opinion, Mr. Philippe Delmotte's and
          Jocelyn Marcotte's computerized virtual mediums are perfect.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">I
          strongly suspect the so-called &quot;error&quot; of Euler's method to
          be actually the most basic property of waves. Because energy
          transmission is performed step by step in all well known waves such as
          sound, this obviously &quot;<b><i>quantum</i></b>-like&quot; anomaly
          (especially for shorter wavelengths) should be present.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">It
          turns out that true waves are not perfect. As a consequence, matter
          standing waves should oppose a very weak resistance to traveling waves
          emitted by all matter in the universe. They should be progressively
          scattered. The result after millions and millions of wavelengths is
          matter's standing wave amplification. Thus matter standing waves can
          constantly emit energy without fading out.</p>

          whose amplification returns energy equally towards both particles. The
          force is exerted equally in two opposite directions as a result of the
          radiation pressure.</p>

          seen from this field's point of view, there is no action and reaction
          any more, but rather two opposite and equal actions. So Newton's well

          matter undergoes a mass gain as kinetic energy according to Lorentz's

          an energy reservoir which is capable of accelerating them back in
          opposite directions. Thus, a collision between two billiard balls
          creates billions of temporary fields of forces whose total energy
          according to mc^2 is finally returned to the balls. The calculus below

          Special Relativity. If the transformations really occur, a moving
          observer cannot establish his true speed anyway. All observers must
          deal with a perfect reciprocity. Einstein was correct on
          the principle, but he was wrong on the true events.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Relativity
          is definitely true. It is not a theory any more. It is possible because moving matter and forces
          are involving waves. Now, there is a new theory to discover: the <b><i>New
          Mechanics</i></b>. It is much more important than Relativity because
          it is how matter truly behaves.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Matter
          mechanics is
          solely the result of Lorentz's very special Doppler effect applied to
          electrons.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">Matter
          structure is solely the result of Fresnel's diffraction patterns for
          multiple emitters.&nbsp;</p>

          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">The
          <a href="sa_relativity2.htm">second page on Lorentz's Relativity</a>
          was updated again. I added a clock synchronization procedure which is
          consistent with the Lorentz transformations.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">The
          calculus is quite simple. Now Relativity can be easily demonstrated.
          It is not a dogmatic and complex theory any more. Starting from now,
          scientists can no longer ignore this hypothesis because it works, and
          also because everybody can examine it and understand it.</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">I
          will add many similar experiences, but making all this simple needs a
          lot of thinking. I am prepared to work on this for a long time, but it
          is worth the effort because Lorentz's Relativity leads to the New
          Mechanics, which is <b><i>much more</i></b> important.&nbsp;</p>

          is truly the &quot;formula of the century&quot;. It turns out that the
          Lorentz transformations are much more important than Relativity (which
          is all about mystification) because they explain matter mechanics.
          Matter true behavior is important, indeed capital, and Newton's laws
          can now be upgraded by adding the Lorentz transformations effects and
          the mass gain, which is responsible for kinetic energy according to
          the gamma factor (1 / g).</p>
          <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-indent: 35.4pt; text-align: justify">There
          is no &quot;General Relativity&quot;. Gravity is definitely not linked
          to Relativity. It is just a force like other ones, which all act
          through fields of force, albeit they are submitted to the Lorentz
          transformations.</p>

          experiments (such as the Michelson interferometer) which
          systematically yield a null result. Finally, one should draw the
          conclusion that one's velocity with respect to the aether is not
          measurable.</p>
